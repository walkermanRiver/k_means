[Fiori Horizon] Support for view and embed toolbars/dialogs/menus,FPA34-7771,User Story,Open,FPA34,FPA34 - SAP Analytics Cloud Product Mgmt (Derek),software,Augmented BI and Planning for SAC,https://ifp.wdf.sap.corp/cprojects?sap-client=001&STARTVIEW=Projects&OBJECT_TYPE=TTO&GUID=6CAE8B27FCC31ED59D8BCB674218022A&sap-language=EN,High,"Provide support to change the view and embed toolbars/dialogs/menus to the Fiori Horizon themes (morning, evening).
The scope is to do this for Story 2.0 toolbars, menus and dialogs. As we will only be able to deliver this for the embedding scenarios, components that are only available in enterprise and not embedded are out of scope.
Support for horizon themes was committed to S/4 and is planned to be delivered with story 2.0 in H1 2023. The upgrade to horizon can be started after an upgrade of UI5 planned for the early waves of Q1 2023.

Requirements
As an end user I want to be able to consume SAC in the Fiori Horizon Themes (Morning, Evening, High Contrast)
As an embedding LoB I want SAC to adapt to the theme selected in the LoB tenant especially the Horizon themes.
As a product reusing SAC screens, I want SAC to be able to support the Fiori (Horizon) Themes. (DWC requirements)
h3. Current Situation
SAC cannot switch between different Themes as most screens do not support theming.
SAC cannot fully support Fiori Horizon as the UI5 version is too low. (Status August 2022)
SAC Story Canvas Elements do not have sufficient styling options to create the Horizon Look and Feel
h3. Currently planned workstreams (August 2022)
* Upgrade UI5 to be able to support Fiori Horizon [FPA00-47440]
* Work on making the SAC Story 2.0 View Toolbars Fiori Horizon Supported [FPA34-7771]
* Add styling options to allow designers to create a Story canvas theme aligned with Fiori Horizon [FPA34-7314]
* Deliver Fiori Horizon canvas themes to each SAC tenant for Designer to reuse [FPA34-7769]

[Fiori Horizon] Support Horizon themes for Story Canvas,FPA34-7314,Epic,Open,FPA34,FPA34 - SAP Analytics Cloud Product Mgmt (Derek),software,Augmented BI and Planning for SAC,https://ifp.wdf.sap.corp/cprojects?sap-client=001&STARTVIEW=Projects&OBJECT_TYPE=TTO&GUID=6CAE8B27FCC31ED59D8BCB674218022A&sap-language=EN,High,"We need to support the fiori horizon themes (morning, evening, high contrast black and white) for the story canvas. We therefore need to support the specific styling options required for fiori as part of our theming solution and as widget settings. It is defined in detail where a setting needs to be available (theme preferences and/or CSS and potentially widget styling) 
The requirements are derived from a gap analysis and aim at closing the biggest gaps and to get close to the Horizon look and feel. Some small deviations from the defined Horizon look will not be closed.
Additionally we need to make sure that the default proposed colors are aligned with the fiori horizon morning and evening colors. 
The work is split up into three larger areas
* Creating the themes in SAC and shipping them to all enterprise tenants
* Delivering styling option enhancements necessary to make the themes work for OEM scenarios (reduced scope as  only certain widgets are available in the embedding scenrios)
* Delivering styling option enhancements to make themes work for the enterprise scope (all widgets of story 2.0 need to have sufficient styling options to show up in Horizon)
Another work stream is aimed at enabling the horizon themes for the toolbar and the rest of the application.

h3. Why
As part of the new Fiori horizon theme, Drop shadow support is required on widgets. 
This can currently not be done with the capabilities we have in analytics designer or stories or with a content creators capability with manually creating a theme, thus - needs development support in order to meet this requirement. "
SAC BI Calculation required to Calculate the date/time difference between 2 date time (timestamp) fields,FPA34-7814,User Story,Open,FPA34,FPA34 - SAP Analytics Cloud Product Mgmt (Derek),software,Augmented BI and Planning for SAC,https://ifp.wdf.sap.corp/cprojects?sap-client=001&STARTVIEW=Projects&OBJECT_TYPE=TTO&GUID=6CAE8B27FCC31ED59D8BCB674218022A&sap-language=EN,Very High,"*Problem Statement:*

User would like to have a function to calculate difference between two datetime fields. Currently datediff function is able to calculate difference between two date fields only and result is in days.

*Use Case and Requirement:*
This is a requirement to introduce a calculation that allows to calculate difference between two date/time fields (for example: a timestamp) in the SAC story calculation editor. As a report designer in SAC, I should be able to create a calculation that provides difference b/w two date/time fields (for ex: ticket creation timestamp, ticket initial response timestamp, ticket resolution timestamp, etc.) in the SAC story calculation. This is especially important in applications catering to service scenarios, where there are multiple use cases to calculate the difference between any two date/time fields upto a granularity of hours, minutes and even seconds, for example to time taken for initial response to a customer ticket, time taken for ticket resolution etc. This is crucial to measure adherence to SLAs in many businesses. Also, it is important to introduce this calculation in the SAC story calculation editor, as that can also be applicable for embedded SAC use cases who do not have access to standard SAC modeler.

Currently, in SAC it is only possible to calculate the difference between Date between (days between two fields) and not with date and time.

*What already works?*

Today, SAC has DateDiff calculation that works for HANA live connectivity, however this works only if the dimension if of type date and the difference can be found up till ""day"" level granularity.

This also works for embedded SAC tenant in applications like C4C, using {+}extended HANA live connectivity{+}.

!screenshot-1.png|thumbnail!

*What does not work?*

SAC Enterprise customers as well as SAC embedded customers (that include applications like C4C and many other LOB applications that are on HANA Cloud today) have important dimensions - date/time fields stored as timestamps (i.e. both date and time Ex: ticket creation, ticket initial response, ticket resolution, etc).

A very common KPI for them is to calculate the response times, which means difference calculation between two timestamps. This cannot be done today in SAC for following reasons:
 * DateDiff calculation does not support timestamp dimensions,
 * DateDiff does not support hour, minutes and seconds for granularity.

Although un-related, it should be noted that for the embedded SAC usecase, timestamps are not available as hierarchy in embedded SAC, specifically with extended HANA live connectivity.

Hence, As a report designer for SAC, I should be able to create a calculation that provides difference between two date/time (timestamp) fields.

*Priority*

This need to be given very high priority because in the context of Customer Service related business process, datetime based KPI analysis is very important. For example to check the SLA compliance related to initial response time (it could be in minutes or hours. Not in days).

This is also a highly voted for requirement from SAC Enterprise customers as can be seen in this influence request: [https://influence.sap.com/sap/ino/#/idea/258836]
Customers who have voted for such a requirement include:
 * Business Connexion (Pty) Ltd
 * Cargolux Airlines International SA
 * Catigo Analytics AB
 * Cubis Solutions BV
 * ERCROS, S.A.
 * EnBW Energie Baden-W闂傚倸鍊峰ù鍥р枖閺囥垹绐楅柟鐗堟緲閸戠姴鈹戦悩瀹犲缂佺媭鍨崇槐鎺斾沪閻愵兛娑猼emberg AG

 * Lufthansa Technik AG
 * One World Technologies, Inc.

 * SEIDOR CONSULTING, S.L.

Also, in case of embedded SAC customers like C4C where embedded SAC is estimated to be used by over 2500 customers, C4C's current (not SAC) analytics solution allows users to calculate time difference between two time dimensions. A similar functionality is needed for SAC embedded in C4C. In the new C4C Service Cloud context, since C4C are relying only on SAC OEM (as they have not developed any alternative analytics offering in their new cloud native stack), lack of datetime difference calculation will be treated as a critical business feature limitation. Hence this is very important for CX Service Cloud use case perspective.

*In Scope*

Relevant for SAC enterprise and all LOB applications that use HANA Cloud today."

Configure a dimension as a primary key for a model,FPA34-7837,User Story,Considered,FPA34,FPA34 - SAP Analytics Cloud Product Mgmt (Derek),software,Augmented BI and Planning for SAC,https://ifp.wdf.sap.corp/cprojects?sap-client=001&STARTVIEW=Projects&OBJECT_TYPE=TTO&GUID=6CAE8B27FCC31ED59D8BCB674218022A&sap-language=EN,Low,"Please describe your improvement request I want to propose a way for us to configure a dimension of the model as if it was a primary key in a relational database to prevent a member ID from this dimension to be used in another data intersection (another row of transactional data) as explained in detail below. I can think of many cases where people would need to have a unique value for a particular dimension in a data intersection. In our particular case, hiring targets have unique IDs we do not want to repeat. TARGET ID FUNCTION LOCATION VALUE 123 Controllers United States 1 124 Tax Canada 3 125 IT India 7 ... we want to prevent a new data intersection from being entered into the model with the same target ID as shown below: 125 HR Thailand 2 Today the target ID is used as any dimension of the model where you can enter the same value for a dimension to multiple rows of transactional data (i.e. the same way you can add a function like Controllers to multiple target IDs in different locations, you can add target ID 125 in the example to multiple functions or locations as shown in the example above). Another example I can think of is someone who has a Planning Enable table to plan inventory where they can add equipment the company is planning to purchase in the near future. One of the dimensions of the model is some sort of number (a tag or a serial number) which is a unique number for that equipment. If you try to add an equipment with the exact same tag or serial number of an existing equipment already listed in the model, it would throw an error that the tag or serial number you are trying to add is already in use else you could have the following situation which is obviously incorrect because you shouldn't have the same serial number for two different equipments: SERIAL NUMBER EQUIPMENT TYPE BRAND MODEL QUANTITY 12345 Computer Dell Latitude 7300 1 12345 Monitor LG 24GN600 2 What is the opportunity/problem the request will address? The same member ID from a dimension cannot be added/used twice in a Planning Enabled table. What is the expected benefit? This prevents end users / planners from entering incorrect data into the model which could make things a lot more difficult down the line from a process perspective or to the very least would require controls to prevent duplicate member IDs from being used and additional effort to correct those entries in the model.

What is the opportunity/problem the request will address? When users want to import data from something like Excel, the IDs can only be text, but live models do not have this limitation. This creates data type mismatches that block successful model linkages in stories.

- color per range
- symbol per range - all shapes need to be available with all colors (currently limited to circle)
- style of threshold for tables (already available in story preferences but missing in theme preferences)

Currently threshold styling is defined on story/application level. The colors and symbols are assigned on story level. The style used for a table can be assigned in the story preferences or per table.

It is not possible to change the symbol, assigned color or display style (for table) at theme level (either in the theme preferences or CSS).

The functionality is needed as part of accessibility which was committed to S/4 for 2023. Canvas theming will be released to the OEMs as part of the accessibility workstream with the OEM availability of Story 2.0 planned for Q1 2023. This feature is necessary for Q1 QRC to make accessibility theming work as we cannot fulfill the 7:1 contrast to black and white background with one set of colors per threshold.

Possible solution:
- define thresholds in story as today including style; name functions as ID or add an additional ID
- define a set of threshold styles in theme preferences including an ID
- pull threshold style from theme if the ID exists in the theme, pull from story defined style if ID is not available as part of a theme

e.g.

Story defined sthresholds:
 !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! 
Theme defined thresholds:
 !screenshot-3.png|thumbnail! 
Resulting styles
OK - from theme -green circle
Warning - from theme - purple rectangle
Critical - from story - red circle


Additional ideas: theme colors and icon should be reflected in the conditional formatting panel and it can be made possible to override the theme there. A reset button to revert back to the theme setting also needs to be introduced then."

At the customer we see that they store version information on the second structure dimension. In order to achieve an IBCS compliant styling, the user needs to be able to style e.g. each bar in a bar chart with color and pattern.

Builder Panel from BSH:
 !Bildschirmfoto 2022-07-25 um 14.48.43.png|thumbnail! 

*Pain Point*
Currently the user could only use assign colors but there only color and no pattern is available.

*Additional information*
At BMW the version information was also stored in a generic dimension called value type. Here it's also not very convenient to style each bar correctly. Current workaround there is  to use restricted Measures.
Restricted Measures can't be used in the use case with the second structure because SAC does not support to restrict a measure based on the second structure.


*Possible Solution Spaces that were identified*
- allow in the Modeler to define second structure as version dimension and let the user add the semantics in the model (this would help so that the table also can automatically add the IBCS patterns)
- allow user to create restricted measures that restrict on members of the second structure
- enhance the assign colors panel so you can also add patterns"

Main gaps:
 * 
 ## Hierarchies are not acknowledged. A user expects with a selected parent the comments below the parent are also visible
 ## Comments should always be associated with the data, if no dimension member has been assigned # should be default
 ## Input control for version functions as AND filter now, thus not showing any comments with selection, version filter input control is needed for comment widget.
 ## Ideally when comments in the widget are selected, the data associated in the story should be highlighted.
 ## Datapoint classification, thus that there is a filter option ""chit chat"" and ""company Guidance"" for example, including who has the rights to add a given classification

This creates the need for data actions to either copy the calculated measures or accounts into separate stored measures/accounts thereby causing performance issues, thereby even re-executing the whole calculation (also see different approaches for currency measures) with additional strain on the system. With this idea, I propose to provide an option for each calculated measure/formula whether or not to persist the results in the model (cache), right at the moment the user is refreshing/recalculating. Thereby avoiding all of the above side effects &amp; additional modelling efforts. What is the opportunity/problem the request will address?

Problem Statement:

Currently there's no option to sync master data created in SAP BW, directly into SAC. These master data dimensions have to created manually and synced manually.

However for SAC Planning, Google need to import the Dimension Master data into SAC or create private dimensions(duplicate data), with this process there is always sync issues and inconsistent master data and also due to this, Google faced recent challenges in linking dimensions from Live connections to Acquired connections model.
If Google have to migrate from BPC to SAC, without this feature, they have to build a lot of master data pipelines and lot of efforts for maintenance

What's the ask?
Similar to how BPC leverage master data from BW, can SAC be improvised to refer the meta data(master data) from BW live for the Acquired connections model.
This sort of similar feature is availaAP BPC optimized for S/4 product, where BPC leverages master data from S/4 based on views concept.

The Corporate Digital Boardroom presentation is the single entry point of all our assets. From time to time stories are deleted from the boardroom presentation since they become outdated or are replaced by a new version (with new story id).

[Accessibility] Enable reset of color assigned to measure,FPA34-7751,User Story,Open,FPA34,FPA34 - SAP Analytics Cloud Product Mgmt (Derek),software,Augmented BI and Planning for SAC,https://ifp.wdf.sap.corp/cprojects?sap-client=001&STARTVIEW=Projects&OBJECT_TYPE=TTO&GUID=6CAE8B27FCC31ED59D8BCB674218022A&sap-language=EN,High,"Enable reset of color assignment to measure in story 2.0 so color is pulled again from the assigned palette instead of being hard coded after a change was made to either color, pattern or show as (for bars).

When the color of a chart depends on the measure, patterns and colors as well as the way the bar is shown (show as) can be assigned specifically to a measure. If the color sync is enabled, the color and pattern change affects all other charts using the same measure. 

 !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! 

When a story is first created, the default is set for all three. The default is the side by side bars, the solid pattern and a color from the assigned palette.  When a change is made, the color and pattern change but the state of the setting goes from initial or default to custom. That means, the color is now hard coded and no longer pulled from the palette. 

The setting cannot be reset to pull colors from the color palette and there is no workaround like deleting the chart or the model from the story. The only way around it is to create a new story, where the designer never changes show as, pattern or color. Therefore we need to introduce a way to reset the color assignment. 

The functionality is needed as part of accessibility which was committed to S/4 for 2023. Canvas theming will be released to the OEMs as part of the accessibility workstream with the OEM availability of Story 2.0 planned for Q1 2023. This feature is necessary for Q1 QRC to make accessibility theming work as we cannot fulfill the 7:1 contrast to black and white background with one fixed color per measure. As customers most likely have used the functionality in the past, we need to give them the option to revert the setting.

Not all data sources need to be persisted hourly (or even daily), but sometimes the data source needs immediate refresh. Nowadays, we need IT to load a new snapshot of a persisted query-view in SAP DWC when ad-hoc accurate data is needed in SAC. The ability to manually 'load new snapshot' of DWC persistency from within a SAC story could enable our business users to report on an up-to-date data source when necessary As well we could reduce the need to persist all models hourly, just to provide almost up-to-date data when the business desires.

Considering this usage, following are the high priority requirements since these capabilities exist today for explorer:

MUST HAVE requirements:

 * {*}Interop{*}: Launch Data Analyzer from chart in *optimized story* with right click option and analyze the data behind the chart. The context/filters of the chart is passed on to data analyzer. https://jira.tools.sap/browse/FPA34-6394
 * Once in Data Analyzer, allow end user to be able to *switch between chart type and table.* https://jira.tobrowse/FPA34-7630

High requirements, but no showstopper to move to data analyzer:
 * Support of *cascading filters* is required in data analyzer. Today explorer supports that in faceted navigation. Although faceted navigation is not expected, at minimum cascading filters should work.闂傚倸鍊峰ù鍥р枖閺囥垹绐楅柟鐗堟緲閸戠姴鈹戦悩瀹犲缂?

There are 2 implementation steps for this request: (1) Quick-win: There should be a possibility to completely hide the Story-Filter Icon in Viewer mode for critical stories (see attachment). (2) There should be a possibility to hide/customize specific dimensions that can be used a Story-Filter in Viewer mode (see attachment). This request is a re-submission of #Request ID: 227070

Problem: Some dimensions are required in the data source but should not be available for filtering purposes. Example: The Currency dimension is required in the data source to be able to add a dynamic text to show the currency of the display

Benefit: What is the expected benefit? Better overview of available dimensions when user adds a story filter in the Viewer mode. Avoid situations where a user can get more information as intended by the story designer (need-to-know principle). Example: Assume a situation where a Cost Center contains only 1 employee and where a report viewer might be able to filter and find details about this employees salaries, etc. although the purpose of the report is a completely different one."

This behavior needs to be controlled based on condition. For example, if the data is available then the widget should populate else it should be hidden in the visualization and other widgets space should get re-adjusted accordingly

I'm creating this ticket because I haven't found any answers regarding how to change the number scale according to filter applied on the story.

However, if I apply filters to the story selecting only a portion of it, the number should go down to Million Scale accordingly. However, it doesn't change and shows as 1.13 Billion:

In Predictive Scenarios we have to select the forecasting level/combinations on which calculations are done via the entities selection. After the entities are selected, we can filter on them. Filters can only placed on selected dimensions/dimension attributes. It is not possible to select a dimension/attribute as a filter which is not part of the entities selection. We would like to have the possibilitie to place filters on dimensions which are not part of the entites list. (General filter for the data to be conisdered in the forecasting)

There are to main problems. First, we have to include dimensions/attributes into the entities only for enable filtering on this dimension, which will increase the complexity of the forecasting granularity unnecessary (as we have more entities selected then really needed). Second, the list of entities is limited to 5. So we cannot have more than 5 filters. Ife filters are needed, we would have to add preprocessing to the general process of forecasting via data actions and maybee even a seperate model, just for filtering/preprocessing. In total it will increase cost/effort for customers which is against the goal of SAC being a simple to use product for the end user.

In the screeshots attached you can see we have selected 5 entities. Only 2 are needed for the forecasting: Company Code and Material. The other 3 entities are only used as filters.

_What is the expected benefit?_

Avoid extra complexity for seperate pre processing steps and additional objects due to lack of simple filter possibilities in Predictive Scenarios."

Please enable this option. It is available in stories and Applications but not here. Searching with the ID works. But we would like to see the ID together with the descirption.

What is the opportunity/problem the request will address? Some problems: When we overwrite the Compact Display option in design time of the Application with setCompactDisplayEnabled(), this will be reset when we use getDataSource().setVariableValue() to change the Variable value of the query and even cause a bug, in which no dimension value is shown in the table except for the Total value. In image ""Problem1"", on the left, the table Compact Display was turned on by script on initialisation, while in the query, Universal Hierarchy Display is turned off. Then when we change the Variable value per Script, the result can be seen on the right side of the image. The drill function to expand a hierarchy to a specific level is also deactivated in Compact Display mode. It is not practical for user when, for example, we have 2 dimensions and the first dimension as a BW hierarchy turned on. In BEx, even with ""Universal Hierarchy Display"" turned on, we can still choose to expand hierarchy to a certain level. In Compact Display mode, the table axis is represented by a fictive dimension ""1DG_2"" and getSelection() on the table axis returns values that cannot be used.

[Prompting] Clear/purge/delete prompt values/answers previously provided,FPA34-7093,Backlog Item,Open,FPA34,FPA34 - SAP Analytics Cloud Product Mgmt (Derek),software,Augmented BI and Planning for SAC,https://ifp.wdf.sap.corp/cprojects?sap-client=001&STARTVIEW=Projects&OBJECT_TYPE=TTO&GUID=6CAE8B27FCC31ED59D8BCB674218022A&sap-language=EN,Medium,"Today, when providing answers to mandatory prompts in BW (or even optional prompts) the last answers provided are retained and its not possible to 'clear/purge or delete' these values previously provided. This is expect behaviour.

However, this behaviour is problematic in a production environment that enjoys a good life-cycle management and when users are some how segregated.

The problem is that when the story is developed in 'development', the prompts answers are provided and of course remembered even when the story is transported to production. It means that when you open the story in production is shows the last prompt values provided, which are the ones entered in development. 

This is a problem. because the value used in development might be for say 'Belgium', but the story is being opened by a set of users from 'Croatia', it means the users in Croatia have to keep changing the default value. It makes it really annoying because the dynamic default values are also not respected.

This means, that the business problem could be resolved by this JIRA ER, or (on some occasions, but not all) by another JIRA where by the default dynamic values are respected (except for time based objects as per JIRA https://sapjira.wdf.sap.corp/browse/FPA34-2869), however its highly likely this JIRA will be needed in its entirety and especially when non-default dynamic variables are used.

There is a workaround, but its a little poor:

The workaround is to change the mandatory prompts to optional ones, then run the story removing all prompt values. Save the story. Then change the optional prompts back to mandatory. This workaround, apart from the obvious downsides, also has a number of limitations when queries are merged together. Its seems very problematic in such cases as two prompt screens are then shown. (its unclear if the two prompts screen issue is resolved once the prompts are set back to mandatory or not).

A bit more:
The feature was provided in SAP BusinessObjects BI Platform Web Intelligence and customers are expecting this to be present in SAC.

What is this request:
The request is to provide a means by which a story developer can clear/purge/delete prompt values/answers previously provided, even for mandatory prompts as much as optional prompts. The story developer should then be able to save the story with the previous prompt values having been removed.

""# - Unassigned"" member of a reference dimension shoud support Validation Rule with All members of MATCHED Dimension. What is the opportunity/problem the request will address? We often use ""# - Unassigned"" member on a dimension, let's call it ""dim A"", when this dimension ""dim A"" is not relevant for the current key figure. In this case, any validation rule constraining what members of reference dimension ""dim A"" can be combined with what members of the MATCHED dimension, let's call it ""dim B"" is NOT RELEVANT as the usage of ""# - Unassigned member"" of dim A means that we don't care about dim A for the current key figure. So why applying the validation rule in this case ? In this case, we should be able to easily tell to SAC that ""# - Unassigned member"" of dim A (reference dimension) can be used with all members of dim B (MATCHED dimension). The current behavior of SAC authorizes ""# - Unassigned member"" of dim A (reference dimension) ONLY to be combined with dim B members (MATCHED dimension members) that are valid with the other members of dim A ! There is a kind of useless contraint here... The current workaround consists in creating a fake member on reference dimension (dim A) combined with the list of all members of the MATCHED dimension (dim B) (even if there are thousands of members on MATCHED dimension...). This not a good approach. Quite uneasy to maintain. What is the expected benefit? More easy and more logical use from a business point of view, of validation rules in case of usage of ""# - unassigned"" member.

Allows users to track and manage notes associated with ""line item"" type data such as new hires and retain them through various stories without relying on precise intersections when using comments. This fills a major gap in commenting functionality. What is the expected benefit? Ability to use properties as comments but have them persist.

[Filter Across Models] Ability to choose whether indirect filtering should be applied,FPA34-7717,User Story,Open,FPA34,FPA34 - SAP Analytics Cloud Product Mgmt (Derek),software,Augmented BI and Planning for SAC,https://ifp.wdf.sap.corp/cprojects?sap-client=001&STARTVIEW=Projects&OBJECT_TYPE=TTO&GUID=6CAE8B27FCC31ED59D8BCB674218022A&sap-language=EN,Medium,"Option to control indirect filtering when filters on un-linked dimensions are provided in a Story with multiple linked dimensions.

_Usecase_

Two models (Model A & Model B) are linked based on a Dimension (Dim X) and when a filter is applied based on Model A-Dim Y dimension, by default an indirect filter is applied to Model B resulting in long running query on Model B in the back-end even though Dim Y is not part of linked dimensions. User should have an option to enable or disable indirect filtering as not in all cases we might need Model B to be filtered using un-linked dimensions.

Concrete Example:

Story A consists of two pages. Page 1 shows HR data, Page 2 shows Sales data.
The customer wants to have Region (which is a common dimension in both models) as Story Filter and leverage link dimension to have a single selection for both.
Creating Input Controls for e.g. Products (which are just part of the sales model) will create indirect filter & decrease performance, while it is useless in that case.

You can see there is NO way to determine who the parent of PD1 is.

It means the export data API has a limited use-case, it can really only be used to export actual data and not its dimension data, since dimension data without any hierarchy is not complete and thus means its unreliable and requires manual re-work to any changes made in SAC. It means the export data API, even when used with an SAP connector (like DWC or HANA) requires extra manual work and/or unsupported 'adjustments' in the target systems. There is no supported or easy solution to provide to customers and the majority are likely to reject the adoption of the API until this missing feature is provided."

The response time and CPU time in the case of scenario 2 execution were faster compared to scenario 1, after applying widgetimension used in RKF. This proves the filter push down on semantic tag dimension gets applied after applying widget level filter and not happening in RKF.

We have attached both the payload and planviz files to support your investigation.

What is the opportunity/problem the request will address? We have built a New datamodel with a private Account dimension and built many stories and data actions based on it. However, we would like now to replace the private account dimension into a public account dimension. - We have tried to delete the account dimension of the model and create a new public one but SAC does not enable to do it because a lot of stories are built on it. - Moreover, we have tried to duplicate the datamodel and use a similar public dimension instead of a private dimension, and change the model datasource but SAC does not enable us to do it. =&gt; So currently, to be able to replace it, currently, we would have to rebuild the whole model, and rebuild all the stories, which is a huge effort! What is the expected benefit? The expected benefit is to save workload of rebuilding the model, stories and data actions built initially with a private account dimension.

Like S4Hana and BW you should be able to create a Model - this is vital for Lifecycle Management. What is the opportunity/problem the request will address? When you have a single DWC tenant (or even a Dev/Test and then Prod) you cannot switch a Story to point to a different DWC Space without individually editing every widget in the Story. Not only is this time consuming and prone to error, this can destroy formatting of the SAC Object. Having a Live Model would mean you just need to amend the source of the Model - assuming changing the source doesn't destroy all the object links. What is the expected benefit? You could actually switch a Story between DWC Spaces/datasets to enable proper Lifecycle Management. Really I'm asking for the Model to act like a BOBJ Universe which was and is a key selling point of the Semantic Layer and should exist for SAC as it would be a key differentiator for SAC against its competitors.

When using properties on a Version dimension, and users want to create a new version they need to go through a heavy manual process: 1) Open up a story, with a table connected to the planning model 2) Go into Version Management Panel 3) Copy an existing version to a Private Version 4) Publish the Private Version 5) Go into Files Area to find the planning model 6) Open the model 7) Open the Version dimension 8) Add property values to the newly created version 9) If Data Acccess Control is enabled on the Version dimension, add respective teams that use the new version to Read/Write columns 10) Repeat entire above process for every planning model where the same version is needed This is unmanageable. And with application designer, not all steps can be automated yet. Suggestion: On short term: add a Application Designer API to allow easy management of Version properties &amp; DAC read/write setting. On long term: Provide one interface for version creation &amp; property management, working across multiple models, which will be an enabler for xP&amp;A.

This might be achieved through allowing the use of Version and Time dimensions in the validation rules, along with allowing a greater number of dimensions per rule; or through introducing a step to ""assign"" validation rules to Version / Time combinations, along with increasing the number of possible rules per model. What is the opportunity/problem the request will address? Where different types of forecast / plan etc. have different submission requirements, it is not currently possible to use validation rules, since they apply globally to all versions / time periods. For example, you may wish to limit the dimension combinations used for a high level quick forecast, whereas a detailed bottom up budget would not require the same restrictions. In this scenario, validation rules can't be used to enforce the summary level inputs in the quick forecast, because they would also apply to other versions such as the budget. A similar limitation exists where valid dimension member combinations might change over time, e.g. member A is associated with member B up to Dec 2020, but associated with member C from Jan 2021 onwards. Validation rules could not be used here, since they to apply to all time periods. What is the expected benefit? Improved control over submissions where multiple types of planning cycle are performed in SAC, or where valid combinations / submission requirements change over time.

There are different points to this story:
 # Scope Selection through parameter
It would be very helpful for the end user to select a node in a hierarchy as scope for a data action. If the parameter is used in an advanced formula, only leaf level is supported. This is not suitable for the end user, because he would have to select hundreds or even thousands of leaves within a hierarchy to select the complete subtree.
 # Memberset, Data() and Resultlookup()
It would be helpful to being able to 'navigate' through the hierarchy in the advanced formula itself. Especially accessing sister nodes with the respective subtrees.

Example use case from customer BMW:

The customer wants to do target planning on different levels within a hierarchy according to the distribution of values from the previous year.
Special requirement was that disaggregation should stop at a speed hierarchy level.
In detail, this means that the first persona writes the total value to the top node, with all leaves and nodes below being empty. The second persona goes in and allocates this value for the next level, for his/her specific area.
We resolved this by adding dummy-leaves for each hierarchy level where we can write these values to. These were then added in property colums (h0 parent, h1 parent, h2 parent, etc.) with闂傚倸鍊峰ù鍥р枖閺囥垹绐楅柟鐗堟緲閸戠姴鈹戦悩瀹犲缂佺媭鍨崇槐鎺斾沪閼恒儺鈧叧nual_ work.

We&rsquo;re searching for a solution like BPC BPF. When the user submit the task, the access for attached files should be limited. To use data locking task correctly, our driving dimensions should be cost center, gl_account, time and version and it is too hard to manage. Admin user should know every responsible user who will be assigned for related granularity. It means a process(input task + data locking task) should be created for each user. It means hundreds of input task+data locking task have to be managed. Additionally, owner has to select assignee one by one. We created teams for each story. We need to able to select team to assign the task ( because we have more than 1000 users) and we need to follow process user by user individually. We have lots of users and stories. That is why we need more feasible solution. We already have data access feature for dimensions and it is a good solution to hide the related file for the user who pushed the &ldquo;Submit&rdquo; button. If a user is able to change the input data after it is submitted, it means they are able to change the input data even it is approved by the reviewer. That is not preferred case. Customer wants to lock the data after it is submitted. Even if the work file is not accessible via task anymore, it is still available via file repository. So, it should be closed to change data even the file repository. As a result, we can summarize the requirement as below ; If a user has no open task for a specific template, this template should be closed to change for this user even from task or file repository. It should not be closed read the data, it should be closed to change the data. Best Regards Link to request: https://influence.sap.com/sap/ino/#/idea/238364"

Non-Enforcement of Dimension Metadata Validation,FPA34-7429,User Story,Considered,FPA34,FPA34 - SAP Analytics Cloud Product Mgmt (Derek),software,Augmented BI and Planning for SAC,https://ifp.wdf.sap.corp/cprojects?sap-client=001&STARTVIEW=Projects&OBJECT_TYPE=TTO&GUID=6CAE8B27FCC31ED59D8BCB674218022A&sap-language=EN,Medium,"Please describe your improvement request Please add the capability to use some sort of wild card in property based model validation rules. Ideally, you would be able to use some special value like ""&lt;any&gt;"" or ""&lt;all&gt;"" or a wildcard symbol to allow any member in the validated/connected dimension. Currently to do this, you would have to fill out the property of the first dimension with a comma separated list containing all members of the second dimension (e.g. member1,member2,member3.....) and this is not practical. To describe this slightly differently, we need a special value in a property to allow us to turn off validation rules for certain members. Therefore all combinations would be allowed, and effectively validation rules are turned off for certain members. What is the opportunity/problem the request will address? Here is an example use case: A cost center belongs to a profit center, but a profit center does not need to have data in a cost center (example: balance sheet data, revenue data). Current in the validation rules, you can tie a cost center to a specific cost center, but you are not able to allow cost center: unassigned to post to any profit center. The # cost center needs flagged with a * or &lt;all&gt; or &lt;any&gt; or some special value to will allow data in cost center # to be populated into any member of the profit center dimension. Here is another: A profit center belongs to a company code, but a company code does not need to have data in a profit center. Current in the validation rules, you can tie a profit center to a specific company code, but you are not able to allow profit center: unassigned to post to any company code. The # profit center needs flagged with a * or &lt;all&gt; or &lt;any&gt; or some special value to will allow data in profit center # to be populated into any member of the profit center dimension. What is the expected benefit? This will allow SAC validation rules to be better utilized in line with the structure of the data that most customers load from an S/4 source systems (Finance / Controlling). From a reporting standpoint, this will improve data quality by removing invalid combinations of dimensions as this functionality intends. From a planning standpoint, it will allow us to input data by a certain dimension (such as cost center) without worrying about whether it goes to the proper members of related dimension (company code, profit center). This will improve user experience for planners. Link to request: https://influence.sap.com/sap/ino/#/idea/277515"

This would also be the case for BW live data being consumed through the BW bridge.

But what if the customer is bypassing the bridge and consuming their BW queries directly in SAC; bypassing the bridge layer?

The idea behind this user story is to now even bother trying to blend BW live sources in the data suite, but rather take the same approach as Analysis Office when blending data with BW queries; use BW workspaces. Rather than pushing on-prem data up to the cloud and blending there, we push the cloud data down into the on-prem BW workspace and join it there.

We could potentially use the same APIs as AO and the Netweaver Business Client to save effort and create a more modern and user friendly UX alternative to the Business Client.

as requested, I'm creating this request on behalf of the Bosch escalation team:

The customer uses links to open SAC Stories and Analytic Applications via URL from external pages. They are not happy with the loading performance of the content.

During the RCA of the Global Escalation, they noticed a large amount of JavaScript files and are particularly concerned about the SAC application startup runtime, i.e. the time until we start loading the actual story/application. This runtime depends very much on the client resources (CPU) and differ a lot. The regular business user does not have a high end laptop. Hence, the user faces longer runtimes. The team tested the browser benchmark scores (captured via https://browserbench.org/Speedometer2.0/) and found large differences between Bosch end user and SAP clients.

The customer shared 3 trace files for loading a simple application. I have uploaded them here: [Trace Files on OneDrive Share|https://sap-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/p/christian_schoenbein/EptbyZGaM8BCvMPOqXznoXEB-LHR_0JXHw4WSG8PZxRXwg?e=PbVHKz].

Unfortunately, we do not have RAPTR traces. So, I will use the contentlib request fetching the story content as the one relevant to the start of loading of the story/application content. 
# The fast case: We start loading the contentlib after 7.79s.
# The slow case: We start loading the contentlib after 10.59s.

Both scenarios have been captured with a warm cache and only few kB have been transferred. The CPU resources seem to have a rather large impact on this loading time.

The customer expectation would be to be able to open a story/application without having to wait for that long to start rendering the story/application content.

Best regards,
Christian

There are LOB usecases that require this capability.
 # Based a Customer/Tenant's commercial entitlement (which actually is impacting certain application features they can or can not use), certain page's content is only relevant for certain application, so in case the customer doesn't have the entitlement, it doesn't make sense to show the empty page as they don't have the data. Ex. Delivery Execution Page should only be visible for the customer who has licensed SAP Supply Chain Collaboration add-on from SAP Business Network
 # In Ariba Network, there's what so called EAC and GA feature release strategy. So certain features can be available to certain limited customers to collect the feedback and then make it available to others step by step, then general available.

We need to enrich that with data from other models. It is currently possible to blend data between Live and Acquired Data models at the story level.

With the current product capabilities, restricted measures should be created in order to make waterfall charts meaningful (e.g restricted measures to determine the nature of the operating expenses to come up with EBIT). Adding dimensions is useful for drill down purposes only. It would be useful and more powerful to be able to add one measure (e.g expenses) and dimension members (e.g. section: payroll, education, travel, etc.) and come up with the waterfall chart.

A combination of column and line charts isn't a solution. The used dimension isn't a time dimension so a line chart doesn't make sense at all. But the display itself looks better there due to the fact that it's possible to have different scalings on the two Y-axis (see chart [2] in attachment).

The Improvement would be giving a SAC user with no editing rights, the possibility of selecting what hierarchy to use in a Story Filter

At the moment, when a Story Filter is put in place for a dimension with hierarchies, it is possible to select the hierarchy only at the time of setting up the filter. However, if a normal user with no editing rights wants to use another hierarchy, it is not possible to choose which one to use and the user is limited to what the person who created the story used. For example, if I have two hierarchies for Plant, one being DCs and another National Stores, the user cannot choose which one to use in the filter. If DCs has been used at the time of setting up the Story Filter, the user is not able to choose National Stores.

The benefit would be usability and user experience, simplifying the usage of a hierarchy. If the requirement is for the end-user to be able to choose the hierarchy, a workaround has to be used, either having a page filter (or table) with the dimension or having two variables, one for selecting the hierarchy and another one for the nodes."

We are using SAC for a critical Month End Closure related process for Charging & Allocations, where we use the allocation functionality in SAC. The data is provided via BPC source

After successful testing, we would like to export-import the model in SAC to SAC PRD (after transporting BPC datasource changes). As the model is initially pointing towards SAC QA, we would like the datasource to be mapped to SAC PRD at import (or via a manual activity).

At this moment, this remapping is not possible, and we need to completely rebuild the model in SAC PRD.

Time dependent hierarchies for live data connections,FPA34-7523,User Story,Parked,FPA34,FPA34 - SAP Analytics Cloud Product Mgmt (Derek),software,Augmented BI and Planning for SAC,https://ifp.wdf.sap.corp/cprojects?sap-client=001&STARTVIEW=Projects&OBJECT_TYPE=TTO&GUID=6CAE8B27FCC31ED59D8BCB674218022A&sap-language=EN,Medium,"Please describe your improvement request Please enable automate time dependent hierarchies for BW live connection, without necessity to adjust query. Currently, the key date of a Time dependent Hierarchy is automatically derived from the key date of the story, this is the creation date / last saved date of the story. During runtime, the end user of a story is not able to change the key date of the story. As a result, in case that the key date of the story does not match the current key date, the viewer of the story potentially sees data based on an outdated hierarchy. What is the opportunity/problem the request will address? The workaround provided by SAP (the dynamic key date of the query defined in the BW backend) can't be implemented in all use cases, so is preventing some team from usage of SAC. We can't add to master data two variables (input ready), one variable for the hierarchy selection and one variable for the query key date. What is the expected benefit? Whenever the new hierarchy is crated in BW and set as default, it's not refreshed in SAC. SAC story keeps visible the hierarchy that was set as default whenever story was created.

Date fields in query filter in SAC model should accept a dynamic date (like 'system date'),FPA34-7517,User Story,Considered,FPA34,FPA34 - SAP Analytics Cloud Product Mgmt (Derek),software,Augmented BI and Planning for SAC,https://ifp.wdf.sap.corp/cprojects?sap-client=001&STARTVIEW=Projects&OBJECT_TYPE=TTO&GUID=6CAE8B27FCC31ED59D8BCB674218022A&sap-language=EN,Medium,"Please describe your improvement request In the import job of a SAC model you have 1 or more queries ('Data Management' section of model) (in our case we are pulling data from S/4HANA Cloud) In such a model query, we wish to filter on date fields. Unfortunately, we can only select a specific date as value (eg. 2020-08-11). Since import jobs are meant to import data on a regular basis, we would need a dynamic date to be able to pick up records based on the day the import job is run. We would require the following: Field: 'Valid From' Before or Including 'SYSTEM DATE' Field: 'Valid To' After or Including 'SYSTEM DATE' This is useful for example to filter on price condition records that are valid today. We are not interested in picking up all the delimited time ranges with prices valid in the past or the future (millions of records). We only want to import the record with the price that is valid today (day of import job run). See attachments for a screenshot of the problem. Examples of SAC data sources (from S/4HANA Cloud) with these date filter requirements: purchasing info records (API 'API_INFORECORD_PROCESS_SRV') table 'A_PurInfoRecdPrcgCndnValidity' sales price condition records ('API_SLSPRICINGCONDITIONRECORD_SRV') table 'A_SlsPrcgCndnRecdValidity' or any other CDS view or API that has date fields This is already possible when SAC models import data from SAP SuccessFactors (dates have the 'TODAY' option). Our request is to extend this option to other data sources such as S/4HANA Cloud. What is the opportunity/problem the request will address? If the above is implemented, we would not need to change the dates manually every single day to the date of 'today' for all the queries in all the import jobs in all the models that pick up price information (sales prices, purchasing info records, purchasing prices, etc.) or other date-dependent information. What is the expected benefit? This option will make SAC data import functionality more robust &amp; versatile with S/4HANA Cloud imports (and put it in line with approach already taken with SuccessFactors). SAC model data imports and the ability to tweak filter criteria in a more dynamic way are key in a tool where it's all about importing data on a regular basis.

it would be great to be able to pass any free style selections regarding the Planning.setUserInput() api for planning. As long the the data point for the value is uniquely defined this should allow you to update or book a new value with a new combination. (Similar to Addnewrow in the story).

Right now the (ugly) workaround is to use a hidden table, which needs to be filtered first to the needed selection and then call setUserInput().

Would also be great to enhance the error messaging for the setUserInput() to be able to find out which dimension value etc. causes the error. Right now the error message is quite generic and does not help to easily spot the error and understand what has gone wrong.

SAC currently does have the right functions to create a ranking column of a specific measure and therefore the user is not able to create ""TOP N &amp; Others"" comparison based on the rank in SAC. Currently in most cases, the ranking has to be inconveniently calculated in the data source system (etc. HANA, BW, DWC etc.) and it is an irritating task for every HANA/BW/DWC etc. developer. What is the opportunity/problem the request will address? The Ranking function in SAC that the user could use to create a ranking column of a specified measure which he can then use in a calculation to create the ""TOP N &amp; Others"" comparison and much more.

When editing an import in a new model, on the import settings' ""clean and replace"" scoping, if the version is changed, the import should load to that selected version (it does not). What is the opportunity/problem the request will address? It is not obvious that the ""clean and replace"" scoping for version does not change the mapping of the version dimension in the ""map to target"" step, which is where the mapping actually matters. When a user first creates an import, they are able to select the version on the ""clean and replace"" scoping, which sets the version in the ""map to target"", but when they try to Edit the import later, the ""map to target"" does not update/remap. Only when the map to target is empty does the ""clean and replace"" fill in the blank. It should update the the map to target version each and every time the ""clean and replace"" version is changed. What is the expected benefit? Less error and frustration when importing data. The false conclusion the imports need to be re-created because the version mapping is locked in by a one-time-only selection. This change makes the ""clean and replace"" setting feature more useful.

Example: S/4HANA Service ""SD_SOFM_SRV"" has multiple entitites. This perfectly serves all needs today and probably in the future. Entitites useful in thes scenario: One is the SalesOrders basic data, one is the ProcessQuery. I have already created the model &amp; the job to import the Process data from one of the entities. Now I want to extend the model by a SalesOrganization dimension. I wish we could simply Add a second import job on the SalesOrders basic data entity, select the vkorg to be mapped to the newly added SalesOrg dimension and select the SalesOrderID as a join criteria. In the next step assign the orderID to the orderID dimension in the already loaded model as the join criteria and the vkorg to the vkorg dimension as the desired data to be loaded. I configure the this second import job as depending on the first job and it should only update dimensions while not(!) inserting new sales order IDs. What is the opportunity/problem the request will address? Today, given the above example scenario, it is possible to add multiple jobs. BUT it is not possible to do an import without serving ALL dimensions / measures in the model. Instead all dimensions must be served by a datasource query. This forces anyone to always create the perfect datasource with all needed data or maintain multiple SAC models and try to join them in stories (which has it's flaws on its own). What is the expected benefit? Way less efforts concerning the provisioning of the needed data from one single source. Being able to ""wrangle"" multiple sources into one model. I am aware of the possibility to add more queries within one job.

Link dimensions accross Import model and BW Live model on compounded BW objects,FPA34-7365,User Story,Considered,FPA34,FPA34 - SAP Analytics Cloud Product Mgmt (Derek),software,Augmented BI and Planning for SAC,https://ifp.wdf.sap.corp/cprojects?sap-client=001&STARTVIEW=Projects&OBJECT_TYPE=TTO&GUID=6CAE8B27FCC31ED59D8BCB674218022A&sap-language=EN,Medium,"Description We have been facing challenges when linking dimensions across different types of models (BW Live and Import Models). This was covered in incident 352545 / 2021. The scenario is that some BW queries are not performing good enough to support dashboarding in SAC using live connection. One relatively simple way of handling this issue is to schedule the BW query execution in a SAC import model so that data is prepared before the user is requesting it - really nice feature. For other BW queries/key figures performance is very good and BW Live connection is then the preferred option. When transferring user selections using ""Link dimensions"" across tables/charts using the two different connection types (Live and Import models) issues arise for compunded BW objects. One common example is on the article hierarchy. User might select a main category (BW technical name 0CM_CDT3) in one table and then expect another table to be filtered on the selected main category. In BW the standard object 0CM_CDT3 is compounded to 0CM_HIED. This means that when 0CM_CDT3 is loaded to a import model the value is a concatenation of the values for the two objects, eg AH/R335. Even though main category (0CM_CDT3) is linked between the import model and the live model the selection of AH/R335 cannot be transferred to the live model. The live model is using an internal representation of the value. Here the ""/"" is removed so the internal representation is AHR335. Consequence is that live model is not returning any data when filtered on AH/R335 which very much looks like an error to the user and the developer. A workaround suggested by SAP is to create a calculated dimension on the table using the import model in order to remove the ""/"" and match the internal representation. This can be done using a formula like CONCAT(SPLIT([d/""IMPORT_Y__VMMSD_C01_Q0001_ITSMIK15"":AH_SectorDI_6a342q04t2].[p/ID],""/"" ,1), SPLIT([d/""IMPORT_Y__VMMSD_C01_Q0001_ITSMIK15"":AH_SectorDI_6a342q04t2].[p/ID],""/"" ,2)) The calculated dimension format is then equivalent to the live connection and the value AHR335 can be passed on to the live connection which is filtered accordingly. Figuring out this can take a long time and raising incident to SAP since it looks like an error in SAC. What is the opportunity/problem the request will address? Make SAC handle the translation from internal to external representation in a more smooth way without requiring developement each and every time an import model is to be linked to a live conneciton. One option could be adding the internal representation to the import model automatically or showing this somehow to the user, so the user can understand why the linking is not working. What is the expected benefit? To make it easier and simpler for users and developers to utilize the huge benefits of combining import models and live models and transferring filters.

The MDS OLAP engine can run into performance issues when many dimensions are needed-&gt; See Sap note 3116279 In a recent blog post on SAC modelling , SAP is recommending to keep nr. of dimensions not higher than 12. But even SAP's own HR workforce business content has a model with about 24 dimensions... Suggestion: Please optimize MDS engine to handle transactional queries &amp; calculations, or provide a new transactional read/write mode (maybe based on t-SQL), for granular (and still performant!) planning &amp; analytics use-cases. Maybe this also closely relates to datasets vs models and upcoming roadmap item dataset and model merger ? What is the opportunity/problem the request will address? For use cases requiring high-granularity and transactional data sets, SAC is currently lacking a good technical solution to cope with a high nr. of dimensions. What is the expected benefit? Expand use cases of SAC. Performance on granular / transactional models. Meet expectations of customers (HANA powered performance underneath SAC). Some typical use cases that could benefit enormously are: sales planning &amp; analytics (sales orders/products/...) FTE (employee/positions/costcenter/...) planning capex planning (investments/costcenter/wbs/...) project planning (costcenter/wbs/manager/...)

If we want to modify an attribute, we can currently do so with an analytics designer, if we don't want to modify facts, we can do so by not enabling planning or using styles that restrict certain dimensions . Couldn't we have the same capabilities we have for facts for attributes? What I would expect to have, is a new type of attribute that can be modified from the stories, so they depend on one specific dimension instead of combinations (like comments columns do). Imagine we want to have a product dimension were products can be out of production, for sale etc, this way we could actualize it directly from stories, with no need to go to the model, which is user friendly.

We are supporting Dell for their FP&A Planning project with SAC-P. One of their calculation requirement is to show shared percentage based on Product hierarchy. In their planning tables they need to check five years historical data and one year forecast data. All the 6 years data are sitting in one version for the historical data is generated based on different sources and it may be various for different Forecast/Planning version.

While showing all 6 years data in one table, the GrandTotal will calculate the subtotal for all the years. However, the requirement is to calculate the subtotals and shared percentage on each period. Do we have any plan to enhance the function GrandTotal() to have ability to pass in arguments to let the system separate the totals based on a dimension like Date in this case?

The customer also has the requirement to do adjustment for the shared percentage to get the result affect back to the dollar amount. And because of it, the project team have toieve it by creating inverse formulas together with GrandTotal() in calculated measures. The Story formulas cannot be leveraged in this case.

Although Custom Groups are currently only available for BW, and although currently SAC Embedded only supports HANA connections, there's a problem just waiting to happen when SAC Embedded needs to support  connection ID across the landscape.

* The best practices (as documented and shared by myself) describes how live connections should be managed across the landscape. To cut it short, it requires transporting/promoting the connection from source to target and then updating this (now existing) connection and NOT to create a new connection. This is important because of (Custom Groups above), but also because models relate to connections by ID. If the connections have different ID's then the user has to manually change the relationship to the connection each time the model is transported (and this isn't good practice).

So, this Enhancement Request is to allow the SAP Embedded Edition to UPDATE an existing live connection without the need to delete it, but instead to respect the connection ID already present.

Whilst today there are very few customers using the SAC Embedded Edition, this ER needs to be put onto the roadmap. This JIRA also acts as an early 'heads-up' and should be used to input into further design documents.  It's also advised to seek expert help from those with implementation and cross solution expertise.

Currently every time a user does a rank, any existing sort is replaced with the default measure sort of either high to low or low to high. The user must re-apply their own preferred sort after ranking.This applies to ranking by any non-time dimension based on the fix we did for https://sapjira.wdf.sap.corp/browse/FPA85-1393.
Even though they have ""Calendar month"" in their model,but that is not a true DateTime semantic type.
The problem is customer is expecting us to retain the non-time dimension(Calendar Month in this case) based sort order after ranking with a new dimension which we don't support.

Fix Data Locking on Restricted Measures,FPA34-7438,User Story,In Progress,FPA34,FPA34 - SAP Analytics Cloud Product Mgmt (Derek),software,Augmented BI and Planning for SAC,https://ifp.wdf.sap.corp/cprojects?sap-client=001&STARTVIEW=Projects&OBJECT_TYPE=TTO&GUID=6CAE8B27FCC31ED59D8BCB674218022A&sap-language=EN,Medium,"Please describe your improvement request When a cross calculation is configured in a planning model, data entry (and publication) is possible via the cross-calculation on a locked data region. This stops cross-calculations from being a valid use case in forms where data entry is required on one cross-calculation but not on another. This also poses a security defect as users could enter data on ""locked"" regions by using a cross-calculation to bypass the data locks. The work-arounds for this limitation are: (1) to configure cell locking, however this is not possible in Analytics Designer. It is also not dynamic when a user changes the drill state of a dimension in a table. (2) If the entire table can be locked (i.e. no data entry required) then Planning Enabled setting can be turned off. However this limits a whole host of business planning scenarios. Neither work-around fully addresses the needs of many common planning scenarios. What is the opportunity/problem the request will address? Opportunity: By enabling data locking on Restricted Measures in stories &amp; analytics applications developers &amp; consultants can use restricted measures and be sure they are secure in planning projects. This also allows more sophisticated planning forms to be created for specific end user need. Problem: Restricted Measure security is not consistent with the rest of SAC Data Locking principles and is a potential risk for customers looking to manage the data entry process for their business. What is the expected benefit? 1) Improve the consistency of data locking principles across an SAC planning system. 2) Give customers more confidence they can safely use data locking functionality without risk of incorrect entry. 3) Address a very common requirement of being able to see summarized/restricted (but also protected) data in the same table where planned values are required.

However the Data Locking during publish can not be bypassed. But for data actions there is no similar option: ignore data locks always seems ON. This confuses end users with a message that they may have potentially planned data in regions they do not have access to. Data Actions currently are too limited.. so we cannot always properly filter the calculations to regions that users have access to. Proposal: Create a Data Action feature that respects data locks. Such that values calculated for regions without proper access are not posted. In this way, Publish to public version always goes OK. Link to request: https://influence.sap.com/sap/ino/#/idea/252351"

Business Case Scenario:

Controllers are leveraging the Live Review Meetings with the Managers from business side in SAC. To be able to highlight and explain meeting-relevant KPIs in the SAC Dashboard as well as to ensure smooth guidance of the managers through the live meeting, the Controllers want to place comments in the dashboard directly.

We have stuff working for the general Live HANA case, but for historical reasons the SAC model code path depends on the naming because the code was written before LevelType information was available in the InA metadata. In wave 2020.08 last year there was an emergency request from the DWC team to switch DWC models to the SAC model code path so effectively the generic handling was lost back then.

A medium term fix was developed but at the same time the way DWC creates the time dimensions was changed which then necessitated the naming convention restriction for the lowest level of each time dimension (the remaining levels come from DWC created artifacts that meet the required naming convention).

We have somewhat of an idea for how to change the SAC model code path to no l on naming, but given the critical BOLT work right now we just did not have the time to work on this yet."

Development needs to enhance the message with the number of records, in order to workaround this limit, the end user must know the number of records that hits the limit without opening an incident and asking the support to reproduce and ""size"" the number of records.

As long we don't have any documentation giving metrics between the GB memory usage and the number of records to be Published, SAP needs to provide the number of records in the error message.

As central users have all rights and haven't any write restrictions, the Planning area feature doesn't help reducing the volume of the Private version plus during the ongoing publish process, lots of data are re published to the target model even though they weren't modified, it's not necessary and not efficient.

It would be helpful if it was possible to filter versions based on user-defined groups, or to organize versions into folders. Ideally, it would also be possible to hide/archive certain versions. What is the opportunity/problem the request will address? By allowing grouping of versions, it would be possible to store old versions of a company's plan in a certain group without them taking up too much space. It would allow other ways to group versions: for example, to group versions based on the main contributor (i.e. employee/department). What is the expected benefit?

Allow the ability to create a custom variable that could store a fiscal period value and then the variable could be added to each query. To assist with validation, require that the variable is filled in before it is used in a query, and then when entering it into the query, you could validate the current value against the query.

We thought that there is highly recommended have the ability to build in one single input control fixed date ranges and dynamic date ranges as one more option in one selector. This, will give us the ability to create for example a filter which allows user to change easily between dynamic predefined input controls such (from 5 days ago until today) with fixed range input controls (from ""pick a date"" to ""pick a date""). Also, the possibility to change the labels for each of the options.

Usecase Richemont:

Blending BW Live with Imported data -->should this be moved to Blending BW with DWC data?

Following requirements missing from Richemont-side

_FPA00-23077 - Not possible to change member order in a blended table_

 * Today blending is used to complement data from BW query witha. With DWC we would have to create dedicated view, reproducing BW queries, which is an option for specific cases but not for all

-----------------

Usecase Fresenius-Kabi:

Combination of data which are in SAP BW with non SAP data which we integrate in DWC.

With this approach we want to user the power of DWC (unlock data) and combine it with data which we have already in BW and reporting is done via SAC

For example enrich existing sales reporting with non SAP data which are ext. market data, wholesaler data 闂傚倸鍊峰ù鍥р枖閺囥垹绐楅柟鐗堟緲閸戠姴鈹戦悩瀹犲缂佺媭鍨堕弻锝夊箣閿濆憛鎾绘煛?

"SAP Analytics cloud: Need ability to export and apply permissions at ""Page"" level within a ""story""",FPA34-7341,User Story,Open,FPA34,FPA34 - SAP Analytics Cloud Product Mgmt (Derek),software,Augmented BI and Planning for SAC,https://ifp.wdf.sap.corp/cprojects?sap-client=001&STARTVIEW=Projects&OBJECT_TYPE=TTO&GUID=6CAE8B27FCC31ED59D8BCB674218022A&sap-language=EN,Medium,"Original Request:

Currently in SAC, the ""export"" and ""apply permission"" features are only available at the ""Story"" level. Need the ability to export as well as apply object permissions at individual ""Page"" level (more granular) within a ""Story""濠?

Problem: 1> The export capability is only available at the story level. So, even if we made changes to specific pages, we still need to export and migrate the complete story which is quite an overhead from a maintenance perspective. Also, in terms of the readability of code, having smaller chunks of code makes it much more concise. 2> The object-level permissions need to be applied at the ""Story"" level currently, which makes it rigid as it applies to the complete story irrespective of the number of pages it contains. This prevents sharing individual ""Pages"" to different user groups within a story. Having this at the ""Page"" level makes it more collaborative. Moreover, both the above items are basic features available in any reporting tool which is lacking in SAC.

Benefit: With the above two enhancements, it provides the ability to manage the objects at a more granular level (page) than the current state which makes it more efficient from a maintenance perspective. It also provides the ability to share and control the permissions at the ""Page"" level rather than the ""Story"" level making it much more collaborative. Please let us know if you need more details.

In all current BI tools it is possible to work with the help of versioning. In SAC, each time a story is saved, a new internal version should be created, which can be reverted to in the event of an error.

If Sales Group ""A"" is specified as the first in the custom sort but doesn't exist for the first year, when it comes to the second year where ""A"" is present, it isn't presented at the top of the stack.

Currently users can only choose out of a small set of predefined scale formats
 * Default
 * k, m, bn
 * Thousand, Million, Billion

There are many other possible variations, e.g. capital letters or abbreviations. In a specific case the customer needs the option to create a scale format with apostrophes for thousand and million: e.g. 5000 = 5' and 5000000 = 5'' or even 500000 = 0''5

The customer would like to have the option to define such custom scale formats centrally to allow the end-users to choose them for their reports.

Currently due to this limitation the users rather take the numbers out of AfO and build the reports in PPT for pixel perfect reporting instead of using SAC.

SCIM API create user with external id different from SAC userid,FPA34-7279,User Story,Open,FPA34,FPA34 - SAP Analytics Cloud Product Mgmt (Derek),software,Augmented BI and Planning for SAC,https://ifp.wdf.sap.corp/cprojects?sap-client=001&STARTVIEW=Projects&OBJECT_TYPE=TTO&GUID=6CAE8B27FCC31ED59D8BCB674218022A&sap-language=EN,Medium,"Today, when creating a user using the SCIM API with a POST to /Users the:
* request body contains the userName (no user id can be specified)
resulting in a new user being created with the:
* response body containing the userid and the userName

If the SAML SSO is set for mapping on email, the userid is derived from the email address.
If the SAML SSO is set for mapping on userid, the userid is the same as the userName.
If the SAML SSO is set for mapping on custom, the userid is the derived from the userName (but not necessarily matching it).

This behaviour causes a problem because there are times customers want to create a user with a userid different from the userName. This typically happens when performing SAML SSO is set for mapping on custom. In such cases you could well want:
SAC userid: M_SHAW
SAC email: matthew.shaw@sap.com
SAC userName: M-SHAW

SAML SSO is set for mapping on custom because when SAML SSO is set for mapping on userid there are problems. For example the ( - ) dash character causes a problem (as do many others). The ( - ) dash (and others) can't be stored in the userid column (probably resolved with https://sapjira.wdf.sap.corp/browse/FPA00-5334) and so a custom SAML mapping must be used to store the ( - ) version and hence the need to create a user with a different userName from userid. The M-SHAW is used for SAML SSO mapping and integration with the IdP and the M_SHAW version is used because SAC can't store a ( - ) dash. The SAC version needs to look very similar to the _ version as all users are familiar with it.

The workaround continues: firstly the user is created (with a POST /Users) and then updated with a PUT /Users/Userid).  Its 2 steps, rather than 1.

The initial user creation must set the userName to be M_SHAW just so the userid is derived correctly and because you can't specify the userid to be different from the userName. Thus a second request is need to update the users userName.

This JIRA ER is to ease workaround mentioned above, but even when FPA00-5334 is provided, this is STILL a requirement because there will always be times you want a different userid from the userName.

This JIRA is for the POST /Users to allow both the userName and the userid to be specified in the request body and respected upon user creation. It would then mean a user can be created with a single request and not two.

This JIRA will also enable the userid to not be derived from the email when mapping on email. For example, if I want to create a user with userid MSHAW with email matthew.shaw@sap.com, but SAML SSO is set to map on email, then the userid will be derived from matthew.shaw@sap.com which is nothing like MSHAW. So this JIRA will also solve this problem which is very common.

(userName is used for SAML SSO mapping and is changeable when SAML SSO is set to email or custom)

Once provided, the user interface of SAC should change, so its possible that during the SAML SSO setup, both the userName is mapped in addition to the userId to allow for dynamic user creation. Otherwise dynamic user creation won't work very well for such use-cases.

 Hi All,

I would like to share feedback from Monsanto visit this week. I presented BOC to them and showcased the visualizations, planning, predictive and data connectivity capabilities the product offers today. While they like the visualization/exploraration capabilities of the product, they are pretty set on their data access approach. Key requirements that came up during that meeting for Monsanto to consider using BOC are:

1) Live Connections to variety of SQL data sources (Oracle, Exadata, SQL, Teradata, PostGres, MySqL). The data sources are dispersed and while many data sources are on premise, they have a significant number of data sources hosted on AWS. Monsanto has large databases and they are not interested in replicating data for various reasons(having to re-build autorizations etc.) and would like BOC to access those source in a Live fashion 闂傚倸鍊峰ù鍥р枖閺囥垹绐楅柟鐗堟緲閸戠姴鈹戦悩瀹犲缂佺媭鍨堕弻锝夊箣閿濆憛鎾绘煛?like what we do with HANA today. I discussed the offerings that APOS provides and have some follow items to take back to the partner. The current capability of the partner solution is also limited because it only works with SQL Server and Analysis services. We will need to understand their roadmap to support connectivity to the data sources mentioned above, with and without going through the universe layer. I see online SQL access is on our roadmap as well. Do we have any concrete plans on this topic? We will need to look beyond just providing this access through the universe layer as Monsanto is looking to move away from their on-premise BI4 system.

Business Scenario

The Controller in question goes into a report that contains ACT, FC, BUD and YoY changes, for all four quarters, in a table. They only need ACT, but another controller only needs FC, so we are showing all four measures in the report. To save time, both Controllers would like to hide all columns they don't need and bookmark the report, so that they can use it every time with just one click.

Value added

The nature of financial reporting alone makes such a feature very necessary, as these reports are used monthly by all controllers and it makes no sense to have a report for every single use case. Instead, a bookmark of the optimal column layout that is also shareable amongst team members and management would greatly improve usability and reduce effort on Controlling and system level.

However we never delete users, if they leave the company we just deactivate them (That's SAP best practise if I'm not wrong). So, if a user leaves the company we can not change his ownership. Also, sometimes there can be other reasons to change the owner, he may change to a non related department for example. This can also help to accomplish segregation of duties. The owner can share the folder with any person or team even if the folder is in Public. In our case, we have a permissions department that should be the only one with sharing permissions.

Need Development team to resolve this issue to ensure an 'Opt-in' pop up appears even in SSO situation to abide by GDPR rules.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. log in to SAC Tenant as an admin user.

2. Create a new user and open the initial invite email.

3. When the link is opened in the SSO scenario, a pop-up doesn't appear and when the link is opened in the Incognito window without SSO, then the below pop-up appears which is what is required even in the SSO scenario.

The DSGVO departments wants to have this user id in anonym way or deleted completely.

SCIM API to manage (create/read/update/delete) data access controls on models,FPA34-7164,User Story,Open,FPA34,FPA34 - SAP Analytics Cloud Product Mgmt (Derek),software,Augmented BI and Planning for SAC,https://ifp.wdf.sap.corp/cprojects?sap-client=001&STARTVIEW=Projects&OBJECT_TYPE=TTO&GUID=6CAE8B27FCC31ED59D8BCB674218022A&sap-language=EN,Medium,"Today with Acquired and Planning models it is possible to enable 'Data Access Control' within a model. Once enabled, individual dimension values can be set for 'read' and/or 'write' permissions.

It means row level security for acquired data models is supported.

 !image-2021-09-20-09-44-03-409.png|thumbnail! 

The entries into this table can be:
* made manually by typing or selecting the user and/or team
* pasted (using the OS clipboard)

And if the dimension is a public dimension then you can also be
* updated (and on a scheduled basis) via a data source (potentially reading a database table for example once a day)

(There are a good number of limitation regarding the length and number of values that can be entered into a signal cell or entry)

Customers, however, need to programmatically update this table of access rights via an API to ease the integration with provisioning solutions (includes ones from SAP). However such solutions (including ones from SAP) don't offer an 'SQL' or query interface since such solutions are designed to call an API, like the SCIM API. 

*Thus this ER is for the current SCIM API to be extended to allow for this data access control 'table' to be updated for public and non-public dimensions for acquired (analytics and planning) models.*

The API should enable READ (to read all the current values) and to update one or all of them. Ideally, the API should support a PATCH call to either 'add' or 'remove' an individual (or team) to or from the 'READ' or 'WRITE' entries without the need to read and update all the entries (even for a single individual dimension value)

The limitation of the number of entries per 'cell' is out of scope for this ER, but should be handled separately. 

(Related info: limitation per cells is 30 users (and 30 teams?) per entry. But, if you cut and paste values into a single entry (a cell) you can specify a lot more than 30, you can specify up to a limit of 5000 characters!)

as the creator of a connection , I would like to share the ownership of this connection with a team or at least with other users.

In case of vacation or illness, there might be no user to share an existing connection. Also after importing a connection, all sharing settings of the connection are lost 
and as only the creator/first importer is able to share the connection, this could lead to issues when he/she is not available.

when importing master data from S/4HANA the value help for filter on members in the query does not list all values. It's described in the screen actually, but frankly there is no way to list all available values from source. The user needs to know the filter ID to search for it. Strangely one value usually is listed if there is no search string applied.

Hence, overall kind of a strange UX to filter on values in source system. Almost impossible if you don't know the exact filter ID.

The requirement is to *show all available filter values in the filter list*, either on opening or by searching with empty string.

See attached video for an example.

Currently, after renaming an entity, it shows a warning in the build panel. Most of the time, people will choose""Do not show again"" to save the real estate in the build panel. After that, there is almost no visual indicator to tell if there was a renaming ever happened or which entity has been renamed. The only way to find out if an entity was renamed involves clicking the ""..."" of that entity in build panel. it becomes difficult to figure out when the renamed entity is not in the build panel and there are a lot of entities in model which are quit common for real world stories in production.闂傚倸鍊峰ù鍥р枖閺囥垹绐楅柟鐗堟緲閸戠姴鈹戦悩瀹犲缂?

And the main issue is that one function losses the filter value and other does not.闂傚倸鍊峰ù鍥р枖閺囥垹绐楅柟鐗堟緲閸戠姴鈹戦悩瀹犲缂?So for e.g. if the intention is to reset the entire story to the starting points before any actions a user performed in a session such as setting or changing filter values then an icon other than 'Refresh' should be used.

There is also an complain that when connection breaks or there is an issue where the data is not loaded, the user has to basically refresh each and every chart in story. At this point in time user will typically click the central refresh icon but that resets the entire storyll filters as mentioned above. This is more a UI bug than a feature request."
