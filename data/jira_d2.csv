Currently when Ranking values, there is no option to aggregate the remainder of the values that fall out of the top/bottom N.

I, as an end user, would like the capability to display the top or bottom rankings using the top/bottom N functionality and would like to see the remainder of the values to be aggregated and grouped as 'Other'.

??

*Use Case:*

For example: There are 20 vendors with measure value, the chart should display ten bars for the top 10 vendors and in addition to that the sum of the other 10 vendors in another 11th bar at the bottom.

??

*In Scope:*
 * Include the possibility to set the dimension(s) which is/are relevant for the TOP N evaluation.
 * +Current State:+ When there is more than one dimension in drilldown or e.g. a stacked visualization is used then the TOP N currently is applied to the combination of these dimensions. So when the aggregated total of dimension A would be within TOP N but it is split into many small dimension B values it does not show up in TOP N when there are other dimension A values split up in less dimension B values.
 * +Desired State:+ To be able to define dimension A as being the only dimension relevant for TOP N calculation so that only the aggregated total is evaluated no matter how much it is split up into dimension B values.
 * Applies to the sorting by measure values functionality, it should also be possible to define the dimension(s) relevant for the sorting.
 * For ALL dimensions (including Time and Date)
 * This should be applicable for both Stories and Analytical Applications
 * For BOTH Table and Chart widgets
 * For ALL connection types (all live and local acquired)

Today users are not able to aggregate dates to a higher navigational attribute level for reporting, when dates are represented flat.

I, an end user, would like to aggregate dates by navigational attributes when hierarchies for that dimension are not present so that I can perform hierarchical reporting.

??

{*}Business Value{*}:

This would allow users to use their native Date dimensions where hierarchies are not present to still obtain the appropriate hierarchical-type representation with aggregation and roll-ups.

??

*Use Case:*

Example: At the moment one is not able to aggregate dates by navigational attributes to a higher (CW, quarter, year,...) level for reporting, except when using hierarchies, however, hierarchies are not always used for the Date dimension.

When working with dates in reporting, one can additionally display certain attributes of the date dimension.

When Flat hierarchy is used in a table, a user can choose which element they want to display via the Set Visible Properties option. However, this displays both the original value and the selected one. NGN would like to only see the one selected ie Quarter- see screenshot.

Internal hyperlinks (pointing to another story) today will only capture in-context dimension to carry over to the destination, story and page filter context is not taken into account.

I, as a Story Designer, would like to specify the dimensions to be used for the filter context to be reflected with the hyperlink so that an end user has less user selections to select in the destination (page or external content).

??

*Business Value:*

This will allow for expanded capabilities when moving between pages and lessen the amount of new selections a user has to make in the destination (page or external content).

??

*Use Case:*

Allow story designers to specify the dimension for filter context to be carried over with internal hyperlink (similar to external hyperlink)to include:
 * Story filters
 * Page filters
 * Linked analysis

Allowing designers to choose a dimension (vs choosing a specific filter) will allow to capture dimension value after filtering at all levels: story, page and widget. The destination story will display filter context from original story as a transient story filter.

Destination story needs to contain a model with the same dimensions, otherwise a filter should be dismissed.

Currently, the variance of SAC has two fixed colors: green and red and it cannot be edited on widget or on theme level. This inability to change colours disallows customers to engage in accessibility requirements nor those who have a background of either of these fixed colours from viewing variances correctly.

I, as a Story Designer, would like the capability to change the standard variance colours so that users with accessibility requirements can view them appropriately.

??

*Business Value:*

This would allow customers who currently are unable to make Stories accessible expand their footprint and overall usage and adoption of SAC.

??

*Use Case:*
 * RR Donnelley: Has created some variances on different metrics. When they create variance on (Actual- Budget), some of the variances make sense to have Green for Negative value and white for Positive values. By default variance just shows Red for negative and Green for Positive.

??
 * Currently, we have the variance color option in Styling but it doesn?€?t work as per:

!image-2020-09-07-12-10-41-424.png!

??

*In Scope:*

It needs to be possible to customize the positive and negative variance colors in the widget settings as well as in the theme settings (theme preferences and CSS) of Story 2.0.
 * For ALL dimensions (including Time and Date)
 * This should be applicable for both Stories and Analytical Applications
 * For BOTH Table and Chart widgets
 * For ALL connection types (all live and local acquired)

*Additional Details*

The functionality is needed as part of accessibility which was committed to S/4 for 2023. Canvas theming will be released to the OEMs as part of the accessibility workstream with the OEM availability of Story 2.0 planned for Q1 2023. This feature is necessary for Q1 QRC to make accessibility theming work as we cannot fulfill the 7:1 contrast to black and whit background with fix red and green.

The functionality is also needed to make fiori horizon work for the story canvas area.

For example: If I have a chart that outlines Sales Revenue for all 10 of my sales managers with a weekly ""update"" updating sales revenue numbers each Thursday. I would like to have an automated email export to each of my sales managers on Friday to review their performance. This would be a great way for organizations to keep the non BOC users updated.

https://ideas.sap.com/D38501

In providing customer information, PLEASE include why exactly they want schedule report distribution. For instance, current reasons we hear they need export to PDF includes the following:
- FPA34-2161 - I can?€?t access SAC on Android (Chrome mobile browser support tentatively planned for 2018)
- I have users who don?€?t have access to SAC who need reports (Concurrent user licenses now available (December 4th))
- I need a frozen view of the data (Use time filters)
- I don?€?t have an offline mode
- FPA34-2209 - I would like to be able to distribute to tens of thousands of individuals who do not have accounts in my system.
- FPA34-991 - I need to be alerted to changes in my data.
We need to understand if customers really need the type of report distribution found in BOBJ (print layouts, email scheduling, etc.), or if we should be investing first in live notifications, alerts, and online consumption through mobile devices. We may be at an inflection point, and your customer stories and requirements are invaluable.
- FPA34-5636 - I want to distribute SAC reports to my customers.
My customers do not have users on my tenant. For each of my customers I need to use customer-specific settings for HANA input parameters. I also have time-dependent (dynamic) HANA input parameters that need to be set according to distribution time. I have hundreds of customers, so manual scheduling is not feasable. I need a scheduling API to maintain the schedules.

Note: A partner, APOS, is looking at providing scheduled distribution of reports in H1 2018. And internal team is also investigating offering this feature.

*Additional Customer Notes*
- Nestle - Using the grid view as a workaround but not satisfied with formatting and visualization limitation of a grid view. They want the save as pdf to save the whole (even multi-page) document in PDF format.
- CITIC Pacific Mining in Australia - CFO would like us to automatically distribute vehicle utilisation usage reports to each of our business areas. Typically the report will be scheduled each week / month and sent to a defined distribution group. _Why does it need to be via email? Why can't they use the app?_
- Megawork - We demonstrate the use of the Mobile application, and present the risks inherent in sending the reports by email. One of the causes of the PDF request is actually to send reports to users without accounts. Another problem is due to the infrastructure of Telecommunications Services in Brazil, which makes access to data unfeasible in cities far from Capitals, where telecommunication services are bad. I'm waiting for more information on how to release this feature. Do you have some link about the concurrent user licenses?

*Priority #1:*?? *Live models*??

Objective:??

Deliver Influence Idea [229434|https://influence.sap.com/sap/ino/#/idea/229434]. i.e., change live models used in story. Address BI story development and deployment use cases described in section 3.

Scope:??
 # UQM/BOLT stack only
 # Models shall be of the same connection type (e.g., live BW to live BW) but can connect to a different server.
 # Connection type supported as part of priority #1: shall be BW, S/4HANA and HANA OP.??
 # Models can be different thanks to a mapping UI. Measures ids, dimensions ids and properties, dimension hierarchies and variables names can be different
 # A mapping UI shall enable to map source to target entities

 * 
 ** Entities where ID or name match are mapped by default.
 ** Only entities that are used in the story (dependency check) require mapping
 ** Incomplete mapping does NOT prevent user to change model (warning message only).
 ** Mapping can be re-used from story to another when same source and target model are used.

Note: charts based on live BW connectivity reference key figures UIDs, uniquely generated alphanumeric strings This means mapping measures technical names will not be sufficient, This is mentioned in SAP Note [2566938|https://userapps.support.sap.com/sap/support/knowledge/en/2566938]. The development team is aware of this challenge.??

??

*Priority 2 ?€? Acquired Models*??

Objective:??

Deliver consistency i.e., feature parity between live and acquired data models. Address planning story development and deployment use cases?? Enhance the existing functionality and make it available on the UQM stack.??

Scope{*}:{*}
 # Support (like today FPA00-26802) :classic account public (planning & analytic) , universal models, and datasets (embedded and public)., source and target models shall be of the same type.??
 # Feature parity with live models: models can be different thanks to the mapping UI.

??

*Priority #3 Support for DWC,* ??*ACN deep copy, Data Service content*??

Objective:??

Support DWC customers with current live DWC connectivity and future integration using DWC space as SAC data repository (FPA00-48453 DWC support shall also enable [ACN deep copy (FPA00-42619) ??for Data Services content and DWC migration from Analytical datasets to DWC Analytic Models (planned Q1 23)

Scope:??
 # Support model change

|_From_ DWC private/embedded model|_To_ DWC private/embedded model (current)|
|From DWC private/embedded models|_To_ DWC Analytic Models 
(Migration from DWC Analytics dataset to DWC Analytic Model)|
|_From_ DWC Analytic Model (DWC as repository)|_To_ DWC Analytic Model ??(DWC as repository)(future)|

2. Internal APIs to expose the change model service capabilities required for ACN deep copy

{*}Out of scope{*}:
 * Change from an acquired to a live model
 * Change from a classic account model to a universal model
 * Change to live model of different source type (E.g. live BW to live DWC, live HANA OP - live HANA Cloud, live S4H-OP to live S4H - Cloud)
 * Live model based on Universes/WebI Document
 * Legacy non BOLT/UQM stack
 * API to change models for individual widgets.

*2 What Problem are we solving?*

In the course of building or deploying stories (e.g., dev, qa, prod) models may change (see section 3 for use cases). To avoid having to re-create stories on the newly introduced models, customers and implementation partners require the ability to change the models used by a story.??

Today, recreating a story means recreating charts, tables, input controls, blending, linked analysis,.?? filter, sort, rank, calculations, drill, formatting, blending, hyperlinks, thresholds etc.?? This can represent man months.

*2.1 For whom do we solve that problem?*

The enhancements target IT BI content developers of our customers and of implementation partners.

Changing a model used by story is not a trivial change, it impacts the complete story and requires a knowledge of the underlying models and data source.

??

*2.2 Business Value* 
*Wide customer reach, occasional use during BI project. High TCO reduction.*

This feature will be used by all customers occasionally during their implementation projects. In Q2 2022 alone *1000* customers created live connections. This includes the top 20 SAC customers. *Changing acquired model was used by 440* customers in Q2 2022 (out of a total of 4400 that edited/saved ??a least one story) that?€?s *10%* of customers build or maintain content

For acquired models, usage tracking indicated that the current change model feature was used 600 times less often than Saving a Story.

??

*Impact ??: TCO Reduction.*

The feature will enable customers not to have to recreate stories when a change of model is required.??

Ballpark estimate: average of *50 stories* by customer x *2 days* to recreate a story + *1 day* of test & deploy in productive environment: Saving *150 man* *days* per customer and per year.

??

*3 Use Cases / When does this problem arises?*

There are four distinct use cases. Implementation Projects (3.1) is mentioned by all customers and partners interviewed*. Agile LCM (3.2) is mentioned by two third of interviewed partners & customers, Data source migration (3.3) and duplication of content (3.4) by less than a third.
 * {_}Partners: Mibcon, Braincourt, I{_}{_}nfomotion, Pwc, Interdobs, Itelligence, Delaware, Plexxus, Cosmos{_}

_** Customers: Swiss Re, Nestl??, Redbull_

*3.1. BI Implementation Project* *?€? ??mentioned by All ??customers & partners*

Customer ??project starts by developing stories on pre-existing live models and BW queries, Hana Calc View, S4 CDS Views. In the course of the project new BW queries & InfoProviders (respectively Hana Calc Views/S4 CDS Views) and SAC model are implemented.

Newly developed stories need to use the new models/queries ??while other stories will stay on the older model.

Scenarios:
 # Target model is a *_subset_* of initial model to optimize performance, having the initial model is based on BW pre-built content or on a customer master DW content
 # Target model is a *_superset_* of initial model, the project scope grew with new requirements
 # Target model is *identical* but based on different DW architecture e.g. fewer layers, different persistency/staging layers

*3.2 Agile Lifecycle Management* *?€??? mentioned by half of customers & partners*

Customer needs to test stories against different live models within the same SAC tenant ?€?agile LCM{*}?€?{*} (idea [202124|https://influence.sap.com/sap/ino/] 186 votes)

Scenarios:
 # Customer needs to manage complete lifecycle in a single tenant (no capacity to manage multiple tenants)
 # Customer has too many data source instances to have an SAC tenant for each
 # Customer needs to test against production source (data not available in test system)

*3.3 ??Data Source System Migration ?€? mentioned by ??20% ??of customers & partners*

For example customer is moving from SAP BW7.5 to SAP BW4/HANA or from SAP HANA 1.0 ??to HANA 2.0. Stories need ??to based on the new data source. The ?€?Change Data Source?€? feature in the modeler for Live model cannot be used in all scenarios

Scenarios:
 # In a remote conversion at least some technical names will be different.
 # In the case of live BW, charts in stories reference key figure Unique Identifiers (UID), these are unique to the BW query, therefore any ?€?Change Data Source?€? will break the charts. [https://userapps.support.sap.com/sap/support/knowledge/en/2566938]

??**??

*3.4 ??Duplicate content for regional backends* *?€??? mentioned by 20% ??of?? customers & partners*

Customer needs to have N identical stories based on N identical live models connecting to N BW instances in different regions

Scenarios:
 # Customer has a?? decentralized organization,?? BW deployed for each region. Need to develop one story and have duplicated for each BW.
 # Carve Out, original BW instance is split in two systems. Need to duplicate the story to point to each source

Accenture Requirements (February 2018)
----------------------------------------------
It is quite common in Data Science use-cases that users work on their individual models and keep enhancing it. They would not like to share with other users unless they are comfortable or done .

Hence it is required to have a process for sharing models between users e.g. for QA or in a broader context having private models vs. public models in case of PA.
SAC has the similar concept for Stories - if this could be applied and extended to predictive models then that would be broadly acceptable.

BASF requirements (September 2019): 
------------------------------------------
BASF asked for a better ?€?separation of duties?€? (predictive scenarios, data repositories).

SAP (October 2019)
----------------------
Live Predict cannot be used productively due to the current security concept.

Requirements: 
_Short term ?€? restrict access to input and output datasets as well as Predictive Scenarios on session user_
We would require the same security setup as Predictive Factory where a new user requests access to a specific project created in our Predictive Factory instance to determine which Predictive Scenarios the user has access to:

However, we also need to ensure that only these users have access to the live input datasets used for the scenarios in each project as the input data is sensitive.

_Long term ?€? also restrict access to subsets of input dataset depending on session user_
Once calculation views are supported as input to live Predictive scenarios, then we would like to leverage our ?€?GCON?€? authorizations which mean that a filter is set in the input calculation view based on the session user?€?s authorizations in the BW backend. This allows us to hide/expose data at a more granular level ?€? on profit center node for example.

SAP content team 
--------------------
Same as the SAC stories - applications created by Application Design shall be part of the SAC Business Content Library and delivered as such. Hence, all entities and components used during the design of an application, shall be enabled for packaging and delivery via the SAC Content Library. This implies the capability of exporting and importing the application design entity. Hence, also Smart Predict entities such as Predictive Scenarios, Predictive Models and DataSets shall follow the same if used/referenced in the application design.

The capability to export/import and delivery is not only important for the SAC Business Content strategy, but also plays a significant role in the SAC OEM/Partner strategy.

This is a deployment blocker!

 * 1) It is not possible to define in the search that the result should only contain items that exactly start with this characters (e.g. 6ES7<xxxxxxxxxxx>). Today after entering 6ES7 it shows also products like <xxxx>6ES7<xxxxx>.
 * 2) If a user uses 6ES7 to search in the story filters, facet filters etc. than she/he has the possibility to select already available product numbers (meaning: only products that really exist at this certain point of time can be selected. The selection does not cover products which get added a later point of time in the transactional data. To include those as well, users have to check the filters every time again).??

feedback from Arun Godwin Patel (SAP ML Expert - Feb 2019)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * *Automated data preparation (?? la Data Manager)* would be required for some scenarios.

The point I was getting at with the automated data preparation was the features and functionality inside of the old PA Data Manager. As a Data Scientist, if I had the choice to use an automated tool that can help me speed up the time it takes to do feature engineering, I will use this tool every time I have a project.

So actually ?€?some scenarios?€? is more like ?€?most/all scenarios?€?

??Here are some of the capabilities that were really powerful and extremely tricky to do using other tools, that would be really valuable to a Data Scientist:
 * Timestamp aggregations
 * Mass interaction variables (crossing of variables)
 * Complex pivots and aggregations with a UI

??The real key was the fact it can be done through a UI. Of course it can all be done by hand, but for me being able to use a UI to try out new features and quickly create a massive dataset was very powerful. I have this same feedback from customers too.

Participants wanted to have the possibility to do feature engineering (especially pivoting and creating time dependent variables) in SAC directly.

+Feedback from Smart Predict Hackathon (Feb 2019)+
 * Basic data preparation on data source (Like Lumira prepare room)

[Antoine]??what are the expected data preparation features? Should this be on the basis of the dataset???
 [Daniel]??I believe the pain point here was simple data cleansing & calculations/calculated columns (feature engineering) on the basis of the input dataset

+ExxonMobil Workshop - April 2019 (Antoine was there)+
 * Automated data preparation to avoid data extraction from Tableau
 * Remove segments where values = zero
 * Being able to aggregate at different levels = Quarterly vs Monthly
 * Add variables automatically, also for future periods?€?

Currently it is a tedious process to build a dataset for Smart Predict. ??Listed below is the high level steps:
 1) Export selected model data to Excel
 2) Delete irrelevant columns, reformat date columns, etc.
 3) Use Excel functions to aggregate data and concatenate columns to create segment.
 4) Create additional forecast periods for the date range you will like prediction
 5) Add additional Variable column
 If we need to add additional variable columns later, we will have to create a new dataset since we cannot edit existing dataset.

This is a cumbersome, and tedious process for users to go through when we have already have data in SAC.?? Why do we have to export and re-import when we should be able to leverage and wrangle the dataset within SAC?

+BASF+

Requirement to exclude data points for model building if they are obviously wrong (false entry; counter-order) but still skew the time-series badly; alternatively they also like to define a corridor of allowed values for target (?€?price always in [0.9,1.1]-interval; anything outside is a data error?€?)

+BHP+

1.1 Data management:
 The data of the table 1.1 is captured from 1SAP, where the quantities informed are just the ones with nonzero
 measure. This means that the data could not be continuous in terms of time. Hence, the first data
 manipulation is making it continuous, something that can be done with the R model, whereas not with SAC.
 Data Cleansing: The tool is good in identifying values of variables that could create models errors, such as
 #, NA, etc. It provides easy to use tools to depure the data in this respect.
 One drawback would be the ability or easiness of exporting data of a trained model to a csv or Excel.
 Hence, the tool is not flexible enough in data manipulation such as partitions, automatic instances increments
 (e.g. Bootstrapping) or manual data increments (e.g. creating a continuum of instances in terms of time), etc.,
 but good with data cleansing. This leads to a data manipulation for Time Series of 3, i.e. average.

Innogy use case (September 2019):
 --------------------------------------
 In the context of your POC, customers movements (entries, leaves) are being forecasted across different companies & energies (gas, electricity). Smart Predict is used for this.
 A specific data model has been build for the needs of predictive, it includes additional variables, based on calendar information (ex: first/last week of month?€?).
 Forecasts are generated at the level of the week. Forecasts are very accurate, when compared to actuals (out of sample validation) they shows less than 2% of difference.
 o We also touched on two key topics: self-service data preparation & predictive forecasting serving planning needs.
 With regards to self-service data preparation, this is currently a gap in our offering that we plan to solve as part of our product roadmap. We discussed this in the lights of your scenario, where you would like to combine information from multiple tables to build a consolidated data model for predictive ?€? sometimes it could be simple data manipulations like the aforementioned calendar data addition. You also mentioned the use of coding to serve this need, as I mentioned this is not planned for the visible horizon and probably the shortest path on this one would be custom SAP HANA SQL coding (as one possibility). We are very interesting by detailed example of the steps you need to take to move from data in datawarehouses/databases to the final data model.

SAP Global Controlling use case (September 2019)
 -------------------------------------------------------
 SAP Global Controlling colleagues would like to be autonomous (not depending on IT) when building data models for the needs of predictive.

BASF requirements (September 2019): 
------------------------------------------
BASF asked for a better ?€?separation of duties?€? (predictive scenarios, data repositories). 

SAP (October 2019)
----------------------
Live Predict cannot be used productively due to the current security concept. 

Requirements: 
_Short term ?€? restrict access to input and output datasets as well as Predictive Scenarios on session user_
We would require the same security setup as Predictive Factory where a new user requests access to a specific project created in our Predictive Factory instance to determine which Predictive Scenarios the user has access to:
 
However, we also need to ensure that only these users have access to the live input datasets used for the scenarios in each project as the input data is sensitive.

_Long term ?€? also restrict access to subsets of input dataset depending on session user_
Once calculation views are supported as input to live Predictive scenarios, then we would like to leverage our ?€?GCON?€? authorizations which mean that a filter is set in the input calculation view based on the session user?€?s authorizations in the BW backend. This allows us to hide/expose data at a more granular level ?€? on profit center node for example.


SAP content team 
--------------------
Same as the SAC stories - applications created by Application Design shall be part of the SAC Business Content Library and delivered as such. Hence, all entities and components used during the design of an application, shall be enabled for packaging and delivery via the SAC Content Library. This implies the capability of exporting and importing the application design entity. Hence, also Smart Predict entities such as Predictive Scenarios, Predictive Models and DataSets shall follow the same if used/referenced in the application design.

The capability to export/import and delivery is not only important for the SAC Business Content strategy, but also plays a significant role in the SAC OEM/Partner strategy.

This is Takahito Fujimaki of Brainpad support team.

I would like you to confirm if the below behavior of Factory is expected to you or not.

(The version of Factory is latest (3.3.2).)

And it would be appreciated if you would modify Factory (read: Smart Predict) according to our requirement.

[Procedure and result]

1. Two members (project manager and analyst) belong to a project.

2. One user (analyst role) create a new task that the content of the schedule is ""Run every 10 minutes""). The task is executed at every 10 minutes.

3. Assuming that the member (analyst role) has left the company, the other member (project manager role) delete the member (analyst role) from the member setting of the project.

4. After step4, the task is NOT executed.

[Our requirement]

If a member who create a schedule task would be deleted from the member

setting of a project, the schedule task would be available.

As far as I have checked, I need to re-register the schedule task.

But if there are many the schedule tasks, it is inconvenience.

Need to be able to specify a weight variable when creating predictive models,FPA34-2030,4619476,User Story,Considered,FPA34,Medium,I051695,I051666,I051666,2/27/2018 16:29,7/4/2022 13:07,9/29/2022 9:53,,2018.06,,Smart Predict / Predictive Planning ,,,,,,,"In the words of the customer (BrainPad)

We and some of our customer are using weight variables when creating / applying classification model.

> 1. How frequently this is used? It means how many customers, models where this variable is needed?

 

As Antoine-san implied, this feature is infrequently used (4 or 5 customer out of our total 20-30 customers, and they do not always use this feature) because our customers are mainly using their clients' data (non-aggregated data).
Typical cases for weight variables are as follows (these may not be a valid procedures...):

 

1/ In classification model, when target frequency (population) is very low, users use a weight to adjust the frequency of the target.
2/ In regression model (for getting predicted values), one customer (an airline company) uses several weights pattern to try to create many regression models (for instance, assigning 'high' weights to specific data lines / records). They use these models (based on many weight patterns) to validate actual values / predicted values to search a 'best' model (they seem to be using regression models as simple 'calculators' for getting predicted values).
3/ In segmentation model (this module is not included in SAC/Predictive), some customers use aggregated data with weights to create / apply segmentation models,

 

> 2. Why this is used? do regular ways of using classification/regression fail to achieve the goals?

 

For classification/regression (cases 1/ and 2/ as described above), they can create models without weight variables (the feature weight is not 'crucial'). However, the weight enables users to lead to creation of many possible models.
On the other hand, standard statistical analysis packages provide the feature weight as a standard option, so it seems to be somewhat unnatural that SAC/Predictive does not provide this feature.

Customer: Mercy would like to have the ability to *output all segments with corresponding MAPEs and create reports on them.*

-In details: Ability to save the MAPE value for all the models in an excel file from the PF screen or save the MAPE statistics in the HANA database, so that the customer can run a dashboard which displays MAPE via heat map. Otherwise the problem is the customer has to open each model for model evaluation, that is less than ideal for them.- 
 -They would like this functionality to be available out of the box predictive factory without having to do any kind of scripting.-

??

Customer: Dohler > *being able to display & potentially filter out some segments based on MAPE* - report on segment model accuracy for power users when investigating why a specific forecast was created. We need to plan a meeting with Dohler to discuss the SAC requirement in details.

??

Customer: SAP Enterprise Analytics > 
*being able to display the influencer variables in the case of a segmented classification model.*??
*Being able to export/report on HW-MAPE across all segments to analyze & compare errors*

??

Customer: SAP - Operational Demand & Workforce Planning.??

Spoke with Mohamed Judi who was working with internal SAP Finance teams on this use case. They are not working with SAP Enterprise Analytics.

The customer wants to forecast revenue for the different sales bags within SAP for each quarter. This forecast information in turn be used to influence workforce planning and headcount allocation. They are asking for time series forecast to be applied to 1329 segments (each segmented is Region_MarketUnit_SalesBag). *The results are then shown in visualizations via SAC stories to the end consumer.*

The ask is that the end consumer should be able to understand the strength (whatever variable we use, if it is MAPE or ends up being something else) of the predictions for each segment. The business value of this is that the end consumer needs to be aware of whether the prediction is trustworthy or not for production, but they also need to understand the segment's performance against other segments to understand prediction effectiveness. For example, it is hard to say that any segment with a MAPE > 10% is not reliable... it is relative to the other segments. For example, if all the segments have a MAPE around 10% it means that other segments with MAPE around 10% are performing similar to the rest of the model, and perhaps those with MAPE around 15% are not that bad in comparison.??

Mohamed also mentioned it is important to give context around when the model was trained and applied, so that the end consumer can understand if things are out of date which may affect the results.??

Lastly, Mohamed mentioned that the customer is more interested in seeing the MAPE for each segment (where all forecasts are created and information on MAPE is transparent) over filtering out/not creating forecasts for segments where HW-MAPE does not meet certain conditions (see [FPA34-3344|https://sapjira.wdf.sap.corp/browse/FPA34-3344)

Require Quantity conversion just like Currency for Sales/Operations Planning,FPA34-999,3590691,User Story,Backlog,FPA34,High,I818705,I822313,I822313,3/8/2017 21:23,7/1/2022 12:42,9/29/2022 9:53,,,,"Planning (Allocations, VDT, etc.)",,,,,,,"Note:  This request relates to SAC replication models for the purposes of financial planning - in this case Sales.

When customers do any type of Sales planning, they often plan both Revenue  (price) and Quantity.   BOC offers appropriate functionality to plan Revenue at multiple currencies and report a single global currency.   

This request is to enrich SAC by offering functionality to plan Quantity at multiple units of measure and report a single standardized quantity measure.  So, if I plan Product A as 2 cases and Product B at 4 pallets, I can convert my cases to cases at value of 1 and my pallets to cases at a value of 0.25, thus, reporting total cases as ""3 cases"" as my standardized measure.

The Quantity conversion allows for a customer to report total Revenue in USD and total Quantity in Cases, and allows you to calculate pricing via formula at every intersection (Price = Revenue / Volume).  Unbelievable value to that capability!

The display of Base or Standard UOM should work the same way that the display of Local (eg USD next to number) or Default (eg EUR in upper left hand corner of chart) work today in SAC for currency.  In this case Base Unit of Measure should display next to number when in that mode and Standard UOM should display same way as Default currency in upper left hand screen of object.

Note:  Now that SAC has AF/scripting, it makes even more sense to build in Quantity conversion, likely tied to master data setup with rates in a key dimension like a ""Product-type"" dimension.

With SAC as the core planning tool for S/4HANA Cloud, this quantity conversion is in S/4HANA Cloud and is documented here to start:    http://sapexperts.wispubs.com/financials/articles/sap-s-4hana-finance-how-to-activate-and-use-additional-quantity-fields-in-account-based-co-pa?id=5abd2cc95d7946d08f72ddfb9843c835#.WMBn3jsrJPZ

Attachment:  ""SAP UOM"" is the structure of Quanitity in SAP systems (contact mark.p.burke@sap if questions, as I have an active project dissecting this for UOM conversion)

Attachment:  ""Sales UOM in Account Model"" is a diagram of how this could work using a product dimension to drive base unit of measure.  We plan to look into using SAC AF/srcipt to drive the standard UOM conversion in SAC.

Attachment:  ""S4HC Material Base UOM"" is a represenation of how sales quantity is setup in S4HC.  The material master data (or Product Sold if needed) has a base unit of measure.  This base unit of measure comes through on transaction data.   But, the idea is you setup a Product dimension with the base unit of measure, rather than a standalone Quantity dimension because then you run into issues with SAC reporting interface trying to align Base unit of measure and product combinations in Actuals and Planning form.

The modeller allows maintenance of a static UoM using Label(static text) in the Units & Currency field in the account dimension - so we could for eg. say the Volume measure has unit Liter. However, in ByDesign volume of Product type x is liters and Product type y is pieces. The UoM dimension can contain this information of liters and pieces but I need to also maintain this dynamically in the Units & Currency field to take advantage of the right charting and grid representation which is currently available for Label(static text) .

Description
_Please describe your improvement request_

Enable the Report-Report-Inteface (RRI) for BW live connection models.

Currently BW reports are connected to each other using RRI which allows end-users a great way of analyzing data.

Example use case:

Starting from a profit center overview report that shows cost element sums last year actual and current year plan + actual end-user can use jump-to detail report and see in one click the detail bookings for the particular cost element for the particular year for the profit center the overview report was run. (see screenshot)

??

_What is the opportunity/problem the request_??_will address?_

The standard SAC linked analysis / hyperlinking is not able to cover the RRI functionality as RRI is aware of the BW query structure -> in example above column in BW query is defined as selection of fiscal periods -> this fiscal periods are submitted to the receiver report and correctly filtered. Moreover the RRI is using the inputs as variables before the run. SAC sees currently only column named ""Actual 2017"" but not what is behind (fiscal periods).??

Dohler:
 Quoting Sarah Detzler
 they are now testing it with more segments (12.000). Now they face some performance issues (20-30 second per Segment), which leads to training times of days (~3.5 days), which is not feasible for the customer. Even worse, sometimes the factory or the server suspendes sometimes, then the frontend says that more models have been trained but there are no changes in the repository. 
 The use case is segmented Time series based on Products, the database is SAP HANA and we tried it with and without APL delegation

WAGO Kontakttechnik GmbH & Co. KG:
 Quoting Matthias Menz:
 the customer is currently waiting 40-60 minutes for a model training to be performed with just 400 segments on 3 years of sales data (~ 13k rows) while the productive use case is +30.000 segments. 7.5 s per segment, it means the 30K segments would be processed in 2,6 days

Antoine's tests comparing Smart Predict vs Factory: 
 Create a segmented model in Factory - 345 segments - it takes 135 seconds (local model repo) or 137 seconds (HANA model repo)
 Create the exact same model in Smart Predict - it takes 80 minutes - 4800 seconds
 So we have a factor of 4800/135 = 36 times slower in Smart Predict.

*BHP (EAB Customer)*

We plan across approx. 4000 cost centres and 50 cost elements. Can Smart Predict be executed as a batch process to efficiently seed the baseline plan? Or do we need to execute the prediction 1000s of time? And if executing the prediction for multiple combinations, how do you get visibility of the accuracy of each prediction in a user-friendly way?

Regarding BHP?€?s general requirements: 
 o One key point to improve is the scalability of the solution with regards to creating a large number of predictive forecasts in one go. 
 o Ideally one should be able to run the full process to deliver the monthly predictive forecasts overnight. 
 o Currently as a rule of thumb, 3000 dimension crossings would be processed in 5H + 5H (10 hours in total) but this requires intervention in the middle of the forecasting process. 
 o 3000 dimension crossings represents 20% of the overall BHP business and scalability (moving more towards the direction of the 100%) needs to be considered here as well.
 o The last point to consider is that the task is recurring multiple times for each quarter, it would need to be repeated. 
 o In general the faster the predictive forecasts gets generated the better.

*ExxonMobil* *(EAB Customer)*

For smart predict limitation, I try to do is to predict attrition number for all country (99) * all function (34) * all employee category (5) * attrition reason (3). [the data will be less as some combination does not exist] Each combination will have 120 line data (120 months back 10 years). I do not go to that point yet. Now I am working on country by country which not reach the system limitation.

Q to Sarah: If we supported 100 segments on day 1 how much of the market need would that capture?

Sarah?€?s answer??: Around 20%.??Most Customer have 200+ Segments. Sorry that is reality for my German Customer.??

Exxon (live predict beta - September 2019) Right now, it?€?s painful to have the processing timeout (from cloud connector) and predictive engine. We would like to create predictive models on as many segments as we possibly want, based on our data models.

H&M (October 2019) 
 o In general, directly connected with H&M activity, data volumes for classification & time series scenarios are massive. 
 o An example you gave for sales forecasting is speaking with that regards. H&M sells between 5000 to 10.000 different articles (SKUs) and operates across 5000 stores globally. When forecasting at the lowest level (Store + SKU), the potential combinations to forecast are huge (in practice you are approaching such scenarios combining R+ SAP HANA).

Exxon - October 2019 - Live Predict Beta Feedback

We suggested them to split or break the data in order to cope-up with current limitation of 1000 segments.?? But the dataset can not be broken any further than the DEALERS level. So they will at least have 6000 segments.?? And on top the overhead of managing the datasets for each region and city combination.

 # Improved dimension and hierarchy support (filtering, member picking..): immediately relevant to e.g. predict only top 10 entities, rather than all of them. Also in order to calculate turnover, Hager would normally need to predict many other KPIs that together roll-up to turnover. This will easily bring us beyond 1000 entities.
 # Accelerate predictions at large scale: as indicated above, Hager could easily find itself w more than 1000 entities

+Procter & Gamble (January 2022)+

The help needed is to look at this issue I currently have w/ the predictive planning in SAC. Our data set has to do w/ demand planning data with materials split by country by material type. i created the planning model and the story. Then proceeded to create the predictive model. When I try to train the model, it gives and error that it can only do 1000 and less entries.

What I did next was to split up the data into smaller data sets. Splitting by country, then further split it by material group until I could come up with something the predictive model will allow me to work on (under 1000 entries). What you?€?ll see in #3 is how I split it up. I now have 5 predictive models which I all merged into the planning model. The high % of expected MAPE is not an issue because I am just working on test data without much historical data.

??I need to understand if I am doing something wrong or if it?€?s really designed for smaller scale predictions and not at an enterprise level volume of data.",1,1

The objective of Reporting 5.0 is to make management reporting more efficient, insightful and relevant by automating reporting processes end to end with a bundle of new (SAC) technologies.

PwC?€?s has an interest to combine existing SAC technology with own (sdk) logic to offer more functionalities to the user.??

The concept of R5.0 includes 4 main ideas/areas:
 * +Personal Report+: Eye tracking and click behavioral feedback is used to understand the information needs of each user and so rearrange single??components (charts, tables, sections?€?) within a report.??Components that are used/looked at more often are displayed at first,??components that are not looked at are not displayed any more.
 * +Q&A Bot+: 0 wants to use a Knowledge Graph and NLP (natural language processing) to enrich the ?€?Search to insight?€? SAC functionality, so you the report developer can predefine possible questions in advance and the report consumer can questions siri-like using a microphone or via typing questions into a search engine window.
 * +Simulating & Forecasting+: Reporting 5.0 wants to include internal and external data to enrich the Smart Discovery functionality. Furthermore, it shall be accessible by the Q&A Bot feature.
 * +Insight to Action+: Making exports / collaborations possible for external calendar or project management tools (Outlook etc.)

??

In the future, the business environment will be more and more volatile, and unprecedented requirements will emerge more often, where the rapid implementation of decisions offers an essential competitive advantage.??So??you need to be able to delegate findings and the resulting measures directly from your reports, without any media breaks, and with the ability to monitor the progress of work.??

??

PwC?€?s interest is to develop an own Reporting 5.0 solution (using SDK or similar) within the SAC environment, where clients??can choose between one or more features out of the Reporting 5.0 SDK feature set.??So??having an interface to export the data would be helpful here.??

??

*Introduction on Functionality:* In general, there should be some functionalities, which apply to all parts Reporting 5.0. In detail, there needs to be a natural language processing of speech, to build the technical foundation of the digital assistant. Furthermore, all interfaces of Reporting 5.0 need an integration of 3^rd^ party apps (e.g. MS Office / Project), in order to ensure a fluent process without media breaks. Additionally a feedback option for all functionalities, provided by Reporting 5.0, needs to be integrated, to allow the report creator to adapt to the user?€?s favorite reporting content and style. A like / dislike button, as well as a commentary field, gives the report consumer a direct option to change his / her user experience.

??

*Smart Collaboration**:* To effectively collaborate with colleagues, the user should be enabled to move directly from the report to any collaboration tool used in the company (e.g. Ruum, MS Project, or similar). The information shared from the report into the tool includes a link (or similar option to open the report content) to the specific site in the report (including possible filters in use) rather than a simple screenshot. Reporting 5.0 also suggests and learns to pre-select possible recipients for the tasks based on the corresponding report page (based on page content, relationship between KPIs and roles, ?€?).

??

*Digital Assistant:* A fully integrated digital assistant helps the user to get rid of repetitive tasks, usually performed by a person. This includes a connection to calendar (e.g. Outlook, G-Suite, IBM Notes, or similar), phones (e.g. Avaya Softphone, or similar), and room-booking systems in the company. These interfaces enable Reporting 5.0 to schedule meetings between multiple persons (e.g. vie automated ?€?e-mail ping-pong?€?). Additionally, needed accommodation or transport is automatically booked via the corporate booking systems (if in place) with the users preferred settings for payment, travel type, and accommodation type. For this functionality, the integration of payment methods, addresses, contacts etc. is essentially required, to enable the services described in this section.

Further, the assistant will learn from the user?€?s interactions. This contains technology such as autosuggestion of specific tasks or next steps as well as artificial intelligence, which is able to identify contacts, meeting times, locations etc. from written text and combine them in a meaningful context. This AI needs to learn and adapt from the user?€?s behavior which means, that predicted next steps, such as flight, train or rental car booking, fits the user?€?s needs and common travel activities. Furthermore, the speech-controlled assistant allows for interaction regarding specific questions (e.g. which transportation method is most efficient) which uses real-time data to suggest the best option. This includes the integration of external data streams that are available through the company (systems & intranet) and the public internet.

*In a role??of??a??client/customer*??(general) I??would??like??to??have??standard??functionality??free??of??charge??(e.g.??using??the??standard??SAC??calendar??feature/collaboration??feature).??This includes the collaboration of common used 3rd party apps (e.g. MS Office).??If??I??have??to??pay??it??should??be??for??additional??features??(e.g.??using??Ruum, which??has??more??options??and??features), especially all features that are related to the automation of tasks, which speeds my daily work significantly up.

*In a role of a report consumer,*??I quickly want to be able to implement decisions. Thus, I need to delegate insights, findings, and resulting measures directly from my reports, with the ability to monitor and follow-up the progress ?€? without any media breaks. Ideally, I can directly access any sort of communication and collaboration software in place at our company, may it be e-mail, phone, calendar entries, project management tools, or similar. Additionally, I want the system to suggest follow-up activities coming from written text (e.g. mail inbox). This includes the option that the digital assistant understands which information is required and suggests me where I can find those (e.g. on a specific report page).

I also want to track all resulting measures throughout the next reporting periods.??This includes the integration of 3rd party apps (interface), which can be customized to my specific workflow and needs. Furthermore, I would like to customize the information I regularly get (internal & external), such as news for a specific topic or industry, which are combined for me as a daily morning briefing.

The combination of various sources of information into the morning briefing is tailored to the specific user. Depending on his/her role, recent events and developments are prioritized depending on their impact for and interest to the consumer. News and indices regarding a key performance indicator (based on the defined VDT) are highlighted and impacts simulated. An interface to news platforms, social media, and similar is needed to fully leverage the potential.

Lastly, a feedback possibility via a simple like/dislike button and a comment field (optional) should be provided for single contents on a page as well as for a page as a whole. This feedback will be given to the report creator.

????

*In a role of a report creator*, I want to be up-to-date of all resulting measures and their follow-up and accordingly integrate them into the next report(s). A central system for follow-up tracking reduces information mismatches and keeps all stakeholders informed.??Those alerts should be pushed on my system via a short message or notification, which I can switch on / off. Furthermore, the system needs to learn over time, which measures and results are important for me to fit my needs. Additionally the use of AI brings the advantage of suggestions, (e.g. if an important measure is out of normal range) with related actions that I can take to handle this issue.

h2. *Current Priorities for Integration in SAC environment:*

Priority of the following options depend on the Roadmap timelines (which option could be finished at an earlier point of time)

Option A: API that extracts data, this includes:
 # Screenshot of selected chart or whole screen (similar to current pdf export)
 # Metadata like current filter settings, user, time stamp, name of data model (similar to current pdf export)

Option B: If Ruum will deliver API to export to other external Mail or Project Management tools as well, alternative option could be: Integration of Ruum into SAC (Story and App environment) instead of Digital Boadroom environment

 * Combination of SAC Application logic and apps running on SCP
 * Integration of these apps via Webframe into the SAC environment.
 * SAC and SCP are connected to the same underlying HANA to enable interaction

our customers have many models all with airport ID fields (e.g. JFK, FRA). Unfortunately, today, we need to geo-code all those models separately by addidng LAT/LONG fields and using the data wrangling function 'Create Location by coordinate' again and again.

As a user of geo maps, I would like to geo-code the airport IDs only once and then re-use this model when visualizing other models (e.g. air tickets) in a geo map.

So the geo map layer would need to have attributes for 
 1.) the primary datasource (e.g. 'air tickets') for the measure to be displayed
 2.) a secondary data source (e.g. 'airports') which contains the geo codes / IDs
 3.) the linking dimension, which is in both models, in this case the airport ID

Such a feature would be very powerful, cause a customer (or SAP) could set up a library of geo-coded models which can be reused by any user, without the hazzle of knowing how to geo-code manually. Concur would create such models for airports, car rental offices, train stations, etc..",6,1

But, when compared to past functionality in previous SAP tools (including BPC NW and BPC MSFT), the formulas are too restrictive.

Options include
1.)	LOOKUP ?€? formula needs to be able to read values from more than 1 node.    For example:   EBIT = Lookup (Net Income) - Lookup (Interest) - Lookup (Taxes), where Net Income, Interest, and Taxes are nodes in the account dimension

2.)	Apply a a mathematic operator on a lookup   For example, Multiply the result of LOOKUP by -1

Two workarounds in place today for Option 1:
-	Put the nodes under one common parent node and then use LOOKUP to read this parent node.
-	If the first option is not possible, create a separate calculated auxiliary account adding the values and then apply LOOKUP on this calculated account

A workaround in place today for Option 2:
- typically handled by creating another auxiliary account to implement the lookup, let?€?s say ACCNT_LU. Then read from this account and multiply by -1:    or FINAL_ACCNT = [ACCNT_LU] * (-1)

Under either workaround, we can use the row hide function to mask the extra accounts for users.

But, in the end, the workarounds are not really best practice and lead to extra works and extra accounts.   The request here is to make formulas work more like historical usage of same feature and/or Excel, where a calculation can take place in one cell/formula box.

??

This is for alll data sources and for both live and acquired.?? Live is prio 1.


 In case a story contains multiple live (BW) data models, multiple filters, multiple filter values, it would be ideal to have an option to - temporarily - put the refreshing of data sources on hold.

Currently, the data source is triggered immediately after changing a single filter value. When the user wants to apply a number of filter values, or multiple different filters, there is no need to immediately start the refresh. (Power) users are not able to quickly setup their report this way.

 No unnecessary data loads, user does not need to wait after each adjustment.

Today, I as a story designer cannot re-use single select dimension and measure input controls across different pages in the story.

The same problem applies to the calculation input controls.

I want measure/ dimension input controls to be re-usable across story pages (for example, through an editable controls panel that a user can open/pin on each story page) and ensure that making a measure/ dimension selection is intuitive for story consumer.

Original Request:

Right now, input controls are page level. User would like something like an input control for easy application of story level filters. Please see attached document for screenshots and detailed information.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Problem statement:*??

Today, when using calculation input control, i cannot re-use it across multiple pages in stories, while the same measure is often used across the story. The end users need to navigate back to the original page in story where calculation input control was placed to make a selection, and then go back to a page of interest. To help guide end users, multiple duplicate calculations are created to include an calc input control on each page.

*Expectation:*

I, as a story viewer, want to be able to easily make a selection in a calculation input control from any page in story where it makes sense.

Original Request:??

As a business User I have a calculation which is based on a calculation input control. The feature itself works for them, but it is on page xy, but affects the whole story. I it would make more sense showing it in the story filter bar I assume.

What happens today, is that when they copy over a page and input control is not copied over, they need to create a brand new calculation and a new calculation input control, rename it slightly using hacks like extra spaces in the name so that it acts seamless for the end user.

Team,
 
I am facing a problema when creating a model from a very complex BW Query.
 
This Query has over 100 key figures, with dinamic names.
 
Problems are:
1.- When selecting what keyfigures to load into the model, screen cannot show all of them
2.- After selecting some keyfigures, model misread dimension values.
 
Do we have documented restrictions regarding keyfigres number and dinamic names?
 
Thanks

Ability to define input for a given areas the cube (e.g. Account/Category/Business Unit) where that Account also has a formula for other portions of the cube,FPA34-1005,3597673,User Story,Backlog,FPA34,High,I818705,I818705,I818705,3/10/2017 22:55,3/4/2022 19:03,9/29/2022 9:53,,,,"Planning (Allocations, VDT, etc.)",,,,,,,"Summary:  As a planning user it is often the case that I need accounts formulas to allow input for an entire category/version of data (typically Actuals), or specific slices of a model, but may require formula's to drive calculations for other slices of the model.

Detail: In a typical Planning scenario the majority of the incoming data for the Actual version is known and loaded in as-is (i.e. no account calculations will occur with the Exception of Planning specific KPI's, etc).  For the Forecast and Plan versions, however, it is very common to include calculations (i.e. driver based planning).   As a specific example, the Sales account for the Actuals version would need to be input (and loaded from the source), while in the Forecast and Plan versions Sales would be calculated as price * quantity.  It can also be the case that other (non-scenario) slices of the cube may require a mix of input (e.g. by Business Unit) vs calculation

Some specific scenarios where secondary dimension or multi-dimensional calculations are required (in most cases inlcuding a concept of Input for non-calculated areas):

Version, Account, BalanceType:
-All Actuals should be input
-Completed plans or forecasts should be archived/stored so they do not change, nor degrade reporting performance
-Plan/Forecast calculated accounts should occur only against a specific  BalanceType/Source member (e.g. Adjustment or Allocations should be input) - very relevant for Allocations from/to calculated accounts as the allocation adjustments should be processed against the specific account but on an input slice on the BalanceType/Source dim 

Version, Account (Revenue), Product:
-All accounts are Input for Actuals
-All non ""Base"" BalanceType (e.g. Adjustment, Allocations, etc) should be Input
-Plan/Forecast Revenue calculated as Price * Volume for all Product Family 1, Product Family 2
-Plan/Forecast Revenue calculated as % Margin over COGS for Product Family 3, Product Family 4
-Plan/Forecast Revenue is Input for Product Family 5
	
Version, Cost Center, Project, Account (Expense) - 
-All Actuals are input
-For Cost Center with property X, No Project,  Travel Expense = same period last year
-For either Cost Center without property X, or specific project code then Input

Balance Sheet:
-Per Account a given flow/sub-account (i.e. Ending Balance or a Net Change element) would need to be either blank/non-imputable, calculated (unique per account or range), or Input

In-Model Variance calculations:
-Variances are calculations have to occur based on the version dimension and would require formula's ability to reference the Account Type

Custom Cost Center Calculations:

-Calculate specific groupings of Cost Centers that require a summation and/or difference of several members

Recently, several Presales cycles have involved companies exploring the Analytics Cloud for planning complete corporate end to end processes.  In cases presented for evaluation include opportunities to capture data, but they need an alternative to modeling data.  Let me explain.

If I want to ask Cost Center owner to add details around ?€?line items?€? for travel, training, capital spend, and other areas. These entries consist of detail support with text or a text description, or manual driver inputs, which they build a final value for the cost center.

In many cases, we at SAP might suggest in SAC adding another model, or adding a dimension to an existing model to capture the data by ITEM, and thus the members are Item 1, Item2, Item 3 etc. If we use this design tactic, we end up with a requirement to add TEXT as an identifier to the line item, either in our new column or as a tag.  

I think it would be easier if we developed a simple, independent capability to store the Line Items in a customizable table by Measure/account.  The table does not need to have a 1:1 relationship to the account, seeing how 1 line item table might support data aggregation and calculations for several accounts by Cost Center.  But having a customizable table that allows for storage of TEXT and Numbers and simple calculations would support Planning customer?€?s needs for detail, without impacting the in-memory calculation volume or current measure design for no text or dates.

Design Ideas:

To build a line item widget framework, I suggest the focus is to build a relationally organized line item extension, which work independently but may be called to a story.

For example, a need a widget that organizes or is a container for storing independent Line Item objects. Each object is a design that holds relational lines of detailed items, which would be able to be connected to a tuple. And we would need to introduce either an extended dimension that is a given in a model design, like Time/Category, which is included or excluded in a model.  If included, then the dimension works similar to a DataSource dimension, so that we have an ability to store Line Details + Manual inputs per measure/account.

The design of a Line Item object would allow custom fields be added in an independent relational structure that captures lines of data.  The fields would allow for ID, Measure, TIME dim, Version Dim, Dates, TEXT (incl Boolen, or text pick lists), dimension, calculations, and values. This allows for each line Item object to perform basic math and store the aggregate for the model measure by the dimensions (if needed).

We would have the ability to do things never before accomplished with SAP and Planning.  For example, we could calculate entire sets of Employee costs in this design.

EMPLOYEE		SELECT
POSITION		SELECT
COST CENTER		SELECT
Business Unit		SELECT
Employee State	SELECT
Version		PINNED
New Annual Salary	LOADED
Current Year		SELECT
Start Month		SELECT
Start Year		SELECT
COMMENT		TEXT
Merit Month		SELECT
Global Merit %	POPULATED
Merit Adj %		INPUT
Merit %		SUBTOTAL
Merit Annual Inc	CALCULATED
Merit Adj $		INPUT
Total Merit		CALCULATED
Annual Salary		CALCULATED
Monthly Salary	CALCULATED
Inc Monthly Salary	CALCULATED
Bonus Month	S	ELECT
Global Bonus %	POPULATED
Bonus Adj %		INPUT
Bonus  %		CALCULATED
Bonus Annual Amt	CALCULATED
Bonus Amt Adj	INPUT
Total Bonus		CALCULATED
# of New Hires		CALCULATED



Or simple sets of data like:

TIME			TIME
VERSION		SELECT	
CAPITALITEM		DIM SELECT
VENDOR		DROPLIST or DIM
REQUISITIONID	TEXT
COMMENT 1		TEXT
COMMENT 2		TEXT
Date of Purchase	DATE
VALUE			INPUT


Perhaps if we start simple with a good outline and design, we will see rapid development of use cases.  This gives SAP SAC the opportunity to plan with plan an OLAP capability and a Relational Capability.  Both of which are critical in FPA planning world.

There is potential in the Japanese market. 
Azure SQL Data Warehouse is ranked #31 of the most popular databases with limited popularity. 
https://db-engines.com/en/system/Microsoft+Azure+SQL+Data+Warehouse 

Rationale mentioned by Kentaro-san: 
 In Japan, purchase decision for analytic products such as SAP PA is mainly done by marketing department. But, persons of marketing department hardly buy / configure / monitor hardwares (servers / networking) by themselves. That is why they tend to select ""Public Cloud?€?. The cost of using such Public Cloud is not so expensive for them. 
 Now, many of our new customers (GEO, ANA, Skylark, Golf Digest Online and Shidax) are using SAP PA on 'Public Cloud?€?, and our 'old?€? customers such as MonotaRO is now considering AWS for replacing their existing on-premise environment. 
 For them, to purchase a new expensive RDBMS (Oracle, Teradata, for instance) does not make sense and they use DWHs provided by these 'Public Cloud?€? such as Redshift (AWS) / SQL Data Warehouse (Azure). 
 However, SAP PA does not support these DHWs. This is one of our big sales problem for SAP PA. 
 If SAP PA could support these DHWs, impressions of our customers / prospects for SAP PA would be changed in Japan market.

We have received an Enhancement request from AIIB. 

During the planning process, assignees will need to input data in the planning table. They hope they can also see the simulate result of their decision. The exact use case is: The user will need to input date for 2019 budget. In order to do so, they would like to use the percentage of (2018 Actual/ 2019 his Private budget plan) as a reference to adjust his final input decision for 2019 budget plan.  

Currently, our cross calculation is only working for public version situation. Could this be possible in Input task situation in the private version?

Expanding Variable's Role in Modeling Calculations,FPA34-2524,5015533,User Story,Considered,FPA34,Medium,I818705,I815104,I815104,6/29/2018 13:37,2/18/2022 22:08,9/29/2022 9:53,,,,"Planning (Allocations, VDT, etc.)",,,,,,,"I previously requested this in the Idea space, but wanted to submit a follow-up request based on comments asked by a large existing customer of SAP software. (General Mills) We will be providing feed back and demo content and one question was;

Global variables - create a variable to be used in calculations such as ""if current month then do X else do y"" where ?€?current month?€? could be changed in a central location from month to month?

Given that each model has the capability to use and store variables, but is limited to a single value across time/version in a calculation, the opportunity to leverage this function is minimized.  If we could expand the application of a variable ID across at minimum, TIME and VERSION, but ideally allowing for 1 or 2 other dimension leaf intersections, I think we could then greatly utilize this framework in our calculations more effectively, without adding overhead to an existing model for values that don?€?t fit the model.  And yes, while the values stored may differ in granularity, the use of the variable may be a faster storage and calculation capability then embedding the values in the model or a separate model.
 
One issue I have with using ?€?#?€? is that users do have a tendency to create bad allocations, which will remove if not improperly allocate the values stored in this design we use today, and not realize it.  Whereas the use of Variables are defined to be part of the model, we would not have to blend multiple models if we wanted to build driver based capabilities.  

It?€?s like having mini driver cubes for a model, I a manner to expand the calculation capabilities and give a customer a simplistic driver based platform for calculations.  
 
I know that our new capabilities for Data Actions also plays an important role in this calculation framework, however, I think we have a huge opportunity to extend our value for customers using Variable tables. These storage tables, interfaced from the existing UI, for planning would be a big marketplace advantage for Planning models.  Just think, the process may comparmentalize values which otherwise drive either sparsity or excess density storage of values in many models. In General Mills case, instead of changing the value month to month, why not extend the variable capability to store a value by month, by version and allow the users to interact with the values in a SAC defined grid or chart.

I am happy to build an example in excel as needed, and if you have any questions. Please let me know.

""Hi Team,
 
Here is a summary of the activities at t-l this morning in the context of the SAP Analytics Cloud POC, in competition against Tableau and Microstrategy.
 
POC Status: red
Currently the POC is at risk because we cannot handle the desired acquired data load (from Oracle) in an efficient way to even start the testing.
 
Completed:
 
This morning at Transport Lausannois we were able to install, configure and test:
SAP Cloud Connector
SAP Cloud agent
SAP Hana connection via jdbc connector (see t-l ticket as to why we are not doing live connection?€?old Hana db they will not upgrade until Oct ?€?18)
We were able to kick off an upload of the ?€?Ventes?€? table from t-l?€?s hana database.
 
Challenges:
The above upload didn?€?t complete because it reached an 800 K row load limit.
I learned this morning that the t-l analyst, Sabine, who should be autonomous (joining data to visualizations), needs to work with a dataset from Oracle (not Hana) that has about 60-80 million rows per year. This explodes the initial load capacity of SAP Analytics Cloud by 10x. Tableau guarantees t-l that it can handle 1 billion rows, 100x more than our load capacity.
Performing 10 separate data loads and aggregating the data is beyond the capacity of the end user, and the customer?€?s IT isn?€?t thrilled about losing half a day to do this.
My suggestion to run Oracle through Hana using SDA won?€?t work because the Oracle database is very slow. They plan to replace this database, but not this week.
I offered about 8 times to put in place a Hana database for the POC, using SAP Cloud platform. This is meeting with resistance.
Oracle JDBC connectivity is currently not working. We don?€?t know what to put for ?€?Service Net?€? in the connection, which is a required field.
t-l has not received the pricing information it requires.
 
To delay:
                Denise going on-site to help the end user Sabine get up to speed with SAP Analytics Cloud.
 
My recommendation:
Review architecture and pricing with t-l (Alain IHNE, not Bruno) ?? Propose SAP Cloud Platform services to cover their database and analytical modeling needs* ( 8003371, SAP Cloud Platform SAP HANA service, base edition (64 GB), EUR 2,365.00/month from calculator (one instance because it?€?s for adhoc analysis, no test/dev needed).
Put SAP Analytics Cloud on top (8004107 SAP Analytics Cloud for BI, public option).
 
 
* later expand it to cover their Big Data scenario of getting live data feeds (current speed, etc.) from their buses.

From Knut Heusermann, PM for ByDesign

""one of our biggest ByD customer started a BOC proof-of-concept including an integration with their ByD tenants as data source.
They have support by a BOC consultant, but they are asking me for setup recommendations with regards to the BOC-ByD connection.
A topic which may raise some issues is the extraction of high volume data sources (for example accounting documents) using the BOC OData connector.

we expect that the two largest data sources customer invoice items and accounting documents will generate between 5 and 10 Mio new records every year. Both data sources have more than 100 properties of which 40-50 will be selected. It will not be possible to extract this volume in a single OData roundtrip using a kind of ?€?select all?€?. Even paging using OData top/skip parameter will not solve the issue.""",1,1

As a story creator I would like to synchronize the scaling of both axes for a Column & Line chart to have related measures (e.g. Pipeline & Actuals) on the same scale.

Story-wide measure scaling will only work, when the X and Y axis are to show the same max values across all charts regardless of the values in the charts (the max will be the max of them all, not necessarily within any one chart).

It fails to work, when you have 2 charts, both showing the same dimensions and values, but when 1 of those charts has an additional dimension.
 Why? Because that additional dimension will add more rows into that second chart and then the previous max values are not helpful, since the same max values are used.
 It means the second chart has less value and meaning. The axis is massive (based off the aggregated values of the first chart). The additional dimension has added a lot of low level values where are no where near the max chart axis of the first chart.

What we need is ""Ability to synchronize axes scaling/dual axis"", but not assuming that all charts should have the same scale (when additional/less dimensions are used).
 With the current implementation, this might be resolved with a button on the Edit Axis dialogue called 'Synchronise x and y axis'

From Influence:

Currently, scaling of measures is @ story level.

Issue: We have a stacked bar and Column/Line widget in a page.

If the scaling is enabled -??because of the stacked bar - the Column/Line widget aren't useful due to scaling.

To mimic how S/4HANA works, we would like to be able to have a check box (+/- sign change) on the dialog setup box for Restricted Measure so that the user can indicate if he/she wishes to reverse the sign when setting up a Restricted Measure.  

This will help with LIVE models sitting on S/4 HANA because S/4HANA revenue and income comes through as negative, and the user will be able to reverse the sign as needed when setting up a Restricted Measure to reverse the sign.  This reversal should be available at lowest member ID, but also if required at a hiearhcy node (see https://sapjira.wdf.sap.corp/browse/FPA34-992 for request to make hierarchy available in BOC Restricted Measure selections).

While awaiting this enhancement, our workaround (in our March 2017 release of BOC objects) is to 1) build a Restricted Measure 2) create a calculation referring to same RM and multiply by -1.  This two step process creates two measures and is confusing and more cumbersome for customers.

Better support for BI/Planning Forecast period generation ,FPA34-1779,4431644,User Story,Open,FPA34,High,I051666,I050928,I050928,12/26/2017 17:13,1/12/2022 12:48,9/29/2022 9:53,,,,Smart Assist,,,,,,,"This is consolidated Jira item for all related requests and issues on Forecast period generation.

As a background: BI/Planning forecasting capability is highly used today and a commodity. But because the generated forecast needs more data points??and??there are??confusions??on UI?? and it slightly differs from the behavior with APL/SP - people tend to get frustrated and look for other alternatives.

*Case 1: Current generated number of forecasts??are??not sufficient??to meet many business use-cases*:??

As business user i 'd like to use the Predictive Forecast feature to pre launch my yearly budget done a monthly basis in a Planning scenario.
 In my example I have available Actual data starting from Jan 2015 until Dec 2016 (2 years of existing data). 
 When launching the feature to predict my data for 2017 i only get forecasted data until March 2017 , to get data for the whole year until De 2017 (my budget goes from Jan to Dec), i need running twice the Predictive forecast feature
 The capabilities to generated Predictive Forecasted data must be extended to one year (regular and fiscal year basis).

*Case 2: Guide the user with information help or online help on how the forecasting period is calculated in first place.*??

The formula behind calculation??of future period is nicely described in the blog but it is not evident upfront in SAC UIs or in related feature help. The relevant Jira item is

https://sapjira.wdf.sap.corp/browse/FPA34-1994

*Case 3: Allow user some flexibility in selecting number of periods from UI .*

This is similar to Case 1 and today there is possibility to select the number of periods, but the fact that nothing happens when user selects more forecasts than the feature can generate , it sounds like no change to behavior. The relevant Jira item is??

https://sapjira.wdf.sap.corp/browse/FPA34-2087

*Case 4: Different behaviors for this feature in SP and SA*

This is explained in comments in current Jira and also in Jira item https://sapjira.wdf.sap.corp/browse/FPA78-2517

*Case 5: What is shown on UI does not match to what is produced in the output forecast. This is more urgent than all* *because it??appears as a product bug.*

For e.g. of oZone layer( also see screenshot

[https://jam4.sapjam.com/questions/fnCDm0gZgEBkI89hKMl4xf])??

The main problem from the user standpoint right now is that as a user I am under the impression that it gives me back 49 forecasts when in fact it gives me back 40 with confidence intervals. In this case (205-8)/4 gets 49 periods for forecast but as confidence interval is not available for 9 periods, only 40 get shown to user.??

??

*High level*?? *solution proposal:*

1) Improve messaging and 'forecasting' popup window numbering on UI :?????€?The number of confidence interval for forecast is??y which is less than the forecast Horizon x?€?. At the same time we should correct the Forecasting window numbers that displays ?€?x/x?€? to 'y/x'

2) In addition, I understand that we don?€?t want users to use un-reliable forecast that is without confidence interval but BI /planning smart users do understand the risk and It would be nice that user has ability to get forecast for all 49 periods from this window which is editable anyway. So??in the example of ozone layer - default generated forecast would be for 40(with confidence interval) periods but user notices this warning message as indicated in point 1) and has an ability to take risk and enlarge forecasting window till 49 (without confidence interval).?? This way we are not only consistent with SP/APL; we do cater for more use-cases where available data points window is small and users are disappointed with returned results without any reasoning.

=================================================================

??

Deloitte are working with tesla on a poc of sap analytics cloud. they require the ability in a planning model to do a predictive forecast on a daily level but at the moment it is only available on a monthly, yearly etc basis

can we add daily please?

??

Issue: today predictive doesn?€?t work with models that have a time dimension with lowest granularity 'days'

Impact: Predictive cannot be used with any of the Concur connector models, as all of them need day granularity for other reasons.

Solution: Allow predictive with day based time dimensions. It's OK, if the predictive calculations can still be just on month level!",1,1

The geomap in screenshots can be seen in the story ""YSP GeoReport"".

1. From the screenshot 1 and 2. The largest bubble represents a revenue of 7.78 M, the smallest  6.61 M. Yet the bubbles are in very different sizes, which hinders the user from checking the area performances in the chart. A preferred proportion would be 7.78 to 6.61 in terms of diameter or area.

2. After applying a filter from the input control at left hand side, the bubble become unreasonably small, which leads to confusion as well. The user would expect the bubble retain the same size as in the original chart without filter.

We are about to deliver the POC result to customer excutives and the geomap representation would be an critical decision factor to the deal. Please kindly indicate the feasibility of fixing the above mentioned issues. Thanks! ",1,1

They have a large SAP environment, which is the primary source of data for the current requirements, with some of this data being geo-enabled (reference to geometry in ARC GIS). The proposed solution needs to use the ESRI database, for which the city has a strong capability. They currently have a high demand for geo-spatial reporting. One key requirement is the ability of this solution to consume approximately 300 layers of spatial data (e.g. political boundaries, water catchment areas) from the current ARC GIS environment. This must ?€?super-imposed?€? on the data extracted from the BW system (currently on Oracle), sourced from SAP ECC.

The objective of Reporting 5.0 is to make management reporting more efficient, insightful and relevant by automating reporting processes end to end with a bundle of new (SAC) technologies.

PwC?€?s has an interest to combine existing SAC technology with own (sdk) logic to offer more functionalities to the user.??

The concept of R5.0 includes 4 main ideas/areas:
 * +Personal Report+: Eye tracking and click behavioral feedback is used to understand the information needs of each user and so rearrange single??components (charts, tables, sections?€?) within a report.??Components that are used/looked at more often are displayed at first,??components that are not looked at are not displayed any more.
 * +Q&A Bot+: 0 wants to use a Knowledge Graph and NLP (natural language processing) to enrich the ?€?Search to insight?€? SAC functionality, so you the report developer can predefine possible questions in advance and the report consumer can questions siri-like using a microphone or via typing questions into a search engine window.
 * +Simulating & Forecasting+: Reporting 5.0 wants to include internal and external data to enrich the Smart Discovery functionality. Furthermore, it shall be accessible by the Q&A Bot feature.
 * +Insight to Action+: Making exports / collaborations possible for external calendar or project management tools (Outook etc.)

??

*Use Case Q&A:*

*As a report consumer:*

User interface: 
 The Q&A bot is available via button or via right click menu. A popup similar to ?€?Search to??Insight?€? provides the user with a search mask that uses conversational AI, so ad-hoc questions about the data can be asked as simple as asking for example a colleague. It uses natural language and auto-complete to help finding insights even more easily. Simply by typing in questions, the results will populate as visualizations instantly. Additionally the user should be able to ask the Q&A bot, about all potential fields of information the bot can answer, so that the user gets used to the limitations of the bot and so that the user learns how to use it. This function should also appear on screen so that the user can select topics via clicking on potential topics he would like to learn more about.

Q&A bot as an analysis tool:
 Recipients are able to engage interactively with their report via speech recognition and natural language processing. Users can ask questions related to the figures shown. The report uses a question and answer tree to locate the relevant response, providing report consumer with valuable insights in real-time.??Also further explanations added by the report creator can be attached to graphs to the reporting content and need to be included in potential answers e.g. the bot can read the information aloud to the report consumer or opens an email/text that is attached to the graph. This information is offered to the report consumer automatically.

For the report consumer it would fit perfectly if the look and feel for the Q&A Bot is the same than for Insight to Action.

*As a report creator:*

The controlling department can define questions and answers in advance. The controller needs to be able to add more Q&A possibilities in a front-end environment to allow continuous improvement and customization. By this, the search functionality of SAC (Search to Insight) and own PwC logic running on SCP can be combined to make the search functionality more powerful.

On the long-term a combination of the SAP engine (Smart insights and question pre-defined by the system) and the ?€?own?€? engine with questions that can be added by the report creator could be combined in one Q&A Bot functionality.

*Long-term case:*
 *As a report consumer:*

Q&A bot in combination with personal reports: On the basis of past report interests the bot can offer a summary of the most important changes in the report since the last time opening or offer a ?€?morning briefing?€? where plan/is deviations on the top-management level will be highlighted and potentially external news feeds can be integrated.

*How painful is the current solution:* Medium 
 *Use-case author:* PwC

Basically, there might be two scenarios for the Q&A Bot:
 # Through the SAC Story, the Search to insight functionality is accessible. This can be done either for the whole page or for a respective chart. In Screenshot 1 it??s highlighted in a mock-up, how this could look like (green boxes). After clicking the ?€?Search to insight?€? option, a pop-up win-dow appears where the user can enter the question. The standard ?€?search to insight?€? function is set as a default here. This is shown in Screenshot number 2. Additionally, the admin could maintain a parameter in the settings, which determines the quality of the answer in relation to the question. If the quality of the answer is not sufficient (meaning, it drops below the selected parameter val-ue), an iFrame is triggered in the background, which refers to the Reporting 5.0 Q&A Bot. This is part of Screenshot 3.
 # Stories are built in the App Designer where there is a button that triggers an iFrame that lead either to the ?€?search to insight?€? or to the PwC Reporting 5.0 Q&A Bot. A prerequisite is that ?€?search to insight?€? is brought to the App Designer and it would be accessible via API so the question asked can be forwarded to the PwC Reporting 5.0 Q&A Bot.",1,1

If is far more common that a business user wants to refine an existing chart, particularly when there is existing best practice industry content.  Then with DiBo or story viewing they want to incrementally refine the chart.

Search to Insight -Scenerio/Version phrasing Content for NLQ,FPA34-1969,4567121,User Story,Open,FPA34,Medium,I311255,,,2/9/2018 23:07,11/22/2021 16:57,9/29/2022 9:53,,,,Smart Assist,,,,,,,"The category/version//scenario dimension also need some recognition of some special situations regards to NLQ. 

While a valid NLQ request might be:
- show me sales, 
- or show me total sales, 
- or show me sales for xyz product group, 
Inferred in that statement is both the timeframe and the version they would like to look at.  Without any qualifiers we assume the request is for actual.

For purpose of this Jira item I'm using version and scenario to mean the same thing, All planning is done in a version, it has a unique name:

---BACKGROUND ON VERSIONS-------------------------------------------------
Each version has a Category and a Type assigned to it.
Category defines the level of granularity (daily, monthly, quarterly, yearly) and time range forward in time (future) and backward in time (past)

Versions also have a type: 
Public - everyone can see it who has rights to it, it is more of the ""company"" agreed upon plan 
Private - it is like my private spreadsheet, only I can see it unless I chose to share it.

If a users was to say ""Show me sales Forecast"" or ""show me sales budget"" there is ambiguity in those statements.  Because we have five categories of Versions:
- Actual
- Budget
- Planning
- Forecast
- Rolling Forecast
To help make these categories more challenging, some of the different categories provide different functionality:
- Forecast covers a specific range of periods forward
- Rolling forecast allows the user to specify a number of periods back in history and a number of periods forward in the future
The names themselves are used differently by different companies, some use the term ""Plan"" others use the term Forecast to mean the same thing, some call the annual plan the ""Budget"" and forecasts for the rest of the year are ""forecasts""..

Lastly the version requested dictates the time frames that are valid for that version and are limited by the category selected.  I've attached a screen shot for reference for the category setup.  In it (and this is an extreme example) Actual information is recorded daily, the budget is a monthly budget, when we plan we plan by years (think 5 year plan), We do forecasts by quarter and the rolling forecast is by month, and our rolling forecasts look back six months and forward 18 months.

I've also attached a screen that shows a listing of different Versions, public and private to provide a feel for what someone could be searching for

--EXAMPLES---------------------------------------------------------------------
for describing the version I'd like to see values from or compare to, the request could range from:
- saying nothing and we assume it is actual
Providing the discrete version name
- ""show me sales for the five year strategic plan"" [5 Yr Strategy] (we have to make an assumption, year and yr in the name are the same, strategy and strategic are the same and add up all five years sales)
- ""show me sales for AOP"" ""show me sales for Annual Operating Plan"" mean the same thing.
- ""show me forecast"" ""show me fcst"" mean the same thing
- ""show me Actual""
- ""show me sales for actual at budgeted exchange rates""
Identifying Public or Private versions:
If the users uses the term Public or Private to narrow the search, they could also use ""My"" for private and ""company"" or ""company's""  for public.
- ""Show me the company five year strategic plan""
- ""Show me my working five year strategic plan""
Identifying the version category first
- ""show me sales for the forecast version 1 Work In Process"" 

It may be a challenge if they use the category in the version description, as an example you could have a version named budget 2017 and it is a version category of budget, or it could be a version category of rolling forecast.

RB needs to group the list of consultants, today they do this by duplicating a column and then replacing the consultant, the question that came up is if they now import the data again (e.g. new file next month) do they now have to match the new grouped dimension as well or are the changes replayed?

Richemont expects the grouping functionality from Analysis Office, where you can essentially create a custom hierarchy by repeatedly??grouping dimension members into group nodes and dimension members and/or group nodes into other group nodes. It requires the ability to select multiple individual elements in a table and create a custom hierarchy on the fly, which would become part of the data model in the story.

We tried KPI setting, but KPI is not for calculated measures. 
Then we also tried threshold, but then find out threshold is not work for table.

The internal rate of return (IRR) is a method of calculating rate of return. The term internal refers to the fact that its calculation does not involve external factors, such as inflation or the cost of capital.

IRR is based on NPV. You can think of it as a special case of NPV, where the rate of return that is calculated is the interest rate corresponding to a 0 (zero) net present value.

There are quite common KPIs for financial investment. Detailed explanation can be found here.

The benefit of this would be that you assign more generic roles to parent team and that 'children' automatically inherit the roles. This would simplify the maintenance of the security in SAC.

Customer ABC is very happy about the travel expense dashboard ""SAP_TE_*"" he got from the content library.  He saved the story as ""ABC_TE_* and did some adjustments, added currency rates etc and connected it to his Concur tenant. 

Now with the next import from content library the story was still ok, but all underlying objects (models, currency, import, connections) have been overwritten => a loss of data from customer perspective.

This complex dashboard is linked with a story, linked with models, linked with currency table, linked with import definition, linked with connections. All objects start with ""SAP_TE_*"". There is no way to let the customer build this up from scratch with new object names ""ABC_TE_*"".

So, we need a way to create copies of all underlying objects and still keep the links / relations working in the new name space.

 As a user it is not possible to explore the right data. If you have a linked dimension (see in the attached screenshot FR_01.jpg) (e.g. CL_D360_BPARTNER_DETAIL linked to CL_D360_INSTALLATION_HISTORY) the explore mode does not work properly. When starting the explore mode, only one HANA view (main one) can be explored. In this case it is the CL_D360_INSTALLATION_HISTORY. Including this problem it also shows more accounts than the user should see. 
 For our solution it is a show stopper, because the enduser sees more accounts than he should see (in the explore mode) without seeing the right data.",1,1

*Description based on Swisscom's requirement:*
 I would like to be able to export the results of the application of a predictive model to a dataset, like I can do in SAP Predictive Analytics Desktop today.

I know I can do it using the publication of the apply-out dataset as a SAP Analytics Cloud model then export from there but I would like to have a faster access to such possibility.

*Description from Accenture:* 
 Users of predictive modeling in SAC need a feature to export or download the dataset.
 Currently Predictive datasets are allowed to be uploaded . The application phase in predictive also generates output datasets but neither of these are available for export.

User could publish a dataset as (BI) model in SAC and then export that as file. But there is lot of unwanted data due to nature of BI models. So account, version , category , time dimension are the columns of dataset and that dataset is not directly consumable as a flattened csv file i.e. we need a functionality to export flatten dataset where rows are dimension members and columns are measure values.

*Description based on Daikin's requirement:*

Not possible to consume outcomes of Smart Predict outside of SAP Analytics Cloud. When the output dataset has more than 100 columns, it's not possible to consume it in SAP Analytics Cloud BI Stories.??

*Description based on SAP internal's requirement:*

Multiple users internally have asked for export to CSV/flat file. When the output consists of 100s of rows, the end users would like to export into excel so that they may easily see all of the output. Excel also allows them to filter and sort the data to view it in a way that makes sense to them. This is cumbersome in a story using a table, and tables do have a limit on the number of rows that can be displayed at any one time. The user would like to easily view the predictive output instead of having to build a story and a table to do so. This is also a common request for POCs and Request for Proposals (RFP/RFI). Competitors can already do this.

*Description based on SAP'S ByDesign development team:*

The ByDesign team (Stefan Kraus, Dirk Baumgaertel) is working on showcasing integration between ByDesign and SAP Analytics Cloud. Today, SAC is positioned together with ByDesign for Advanced Dashboarding and Planning and Simulation capabilities. They want to showcase the Predictive functionality.

Their use case is around project management. For each project, they want to predict how many invoices will be successfully closed, and how many will be written off, and aggregate this into KPIs such as Total amount of written off invoices and % of written off invoices. Today, ByDesign data is acquired into SAC Analytics models through the generic OData connector. For Smart Predict, the ByDesign users have to export data into a csv and upload them into SAC as a dataset. Then they can train and apply the model. They want to export the predictive output into a CSV so that they can re-upload the data into ByDesign to create tiles for the aggregated KPIs, but as well to??highlight the invoice level predictions directly in the transactional application.??

Why export to CSV: 1) Bring the predictive insights closer to the process. Given this use case is operational and enhances process related decisions, it needs to be part of the day-to-day process of a project manager. These project managers are unlikely to use SAC, as ByDesign has all the information they need. 2) There is a desire to blend/join predictive insights with other data within ByDesign. The CSV allows the IT user/Database Analyst to join this information with tables in ByDesign. SAC does not provide this capability easily.

+Ask from SAP Controlling Colleagues (May 2019)+

Download SAC predictions as CSV or Excel in order to assess their quality more easily (e.g. via Excel, R).??

Q: Do you mean that they want the download to do this comparison in xls? What does prevent them to do that in SAC BI?

A: Just too cumbersome, too many versions of data and predictions (they do 8 forecast rounds per year, for all board areas, for many P&L line items, with several scenarios each, comparing past predictions and new actuals etc.), too restrictive in SAC. They showed me those mega-Excels that they use to play around with all those data versions, old forecasts etc. Flexibility-wise, SAC doesn?€?t stand a chance. They are an XLS shop, just like everywhere else. Of course, final data is uploaded to BPC as golden record, but interim comparisons are done in Excel, that?€?s just a fact of life and I?€?d do it the same way, if I was them.?? Excel is just more flexible today and it is the established tool.

As part of my ETL and Data admin role, I get requests from the business area owners, of the acquired plants/companies, to bring the data into HCP and eventually blend that data with our existing data on HCP. Here is one such request:

New plants are coming on-board thru' acquisitions. The data for new plants is not in SAP. It will be brought into C4A via spreadsheets. And once we build a model and visualization in C4A, and the data is pulled into HCP via C4A, can we blend this data with our existing HCP hosted HANA instance? Attached is a very basic example of the sample data.

Customer Use Case:
================

Customer is Karl Storz. They have data privacy restrictions that prevent them from replicating their data in the cloud and therefore when users want to blend the HANA models with external data sources or spreadsheets (which typically contain their financials) then they are resistant to using cloud tools. By allowing for data blending to happen on premise and remain on premise after the story is shared makes it for a key differentiator from competitors like Microsoft and Tableau

*Could you detail the use cases these customers are interested in? Are they more related to monitoring of this streaming data or are there other scenarios? Do you have some of these use cases written somewhere?*
We are talking about getting (PUSHing) streaming data into visualization components for the purpose of alerting. For example in a production process, machines are creating different types of events, such as fractures, cleaning, faults, start-up, normal operation, doffing, inching, etc. User would like to monitor these events on their dashboard. That?€?s why we need to have the push functionality, so that vis. component changes as soon as it receives new stream of information. Alerts are generally based on static data (threshold, ?€?business data?€?, etc.) which is then combined on the event data to make a decision: send an alert etc.
??
Since in production environments, there might be lots of different streams (we speak about 500 sensors per machine), only ?€?problematic?€? events (=alerts) will be displayed. The machine operator needs then to react fast and therefore a push notification is required.
??
*What are the chart types they want to be able to display with streaming data? Line probably? Others?*
At least Following chart types should support that:
- MESSAGE with a color?? ; A NUMBER, A TEXT, ?€? (highest priority)
- Numeric point
- Bar & column charts
- Line chart
- Combination Column & Line
- Time series (we also need to be able to display time in minutes at least ?€? DD.MM.YYYY???? HH:MM:SS)
- Let?€?s not forget about the ?€?Linked Analysis?€? functionality -> I see that I have 27 fracture related alerts (on my Numeric point component, then I click on it and the bar chart on the left displays which machines or units or etc have created the alert).
??
*What are the IoT platforms these customers have, if they do?*
MES platform, PCO, ?€?
SAP SDS (Smart Data Streaming) will be the connector to these platforms.
??
*What is the biggest business opportunity you feel you have today with all these customers?*
Being able to process events in SDS (ESP) and display, alert in the dashboard.
IoT: collecting data from sensors ; processing this data real time and alerting the right person / action.
??
There is a nice whitespace of manufacturing customers who could benefit from reporting and alerting (real time) capabilities of data coming from shop floor systems. 
Mainly those customers who choose for an MES system which is not from SAP (MII, SAP ME) and where the MES system is weak in reporting and alerting capabilities.
??
In Belux some examples:
- Bekaert,
- Daikin,
- Puratos,
- Wabco,
- Arcelor Mittal,
And many, many others.
??
One more thing colleagues, only after BOC will be able to accept and display events/alerts according to the PUSH principle (for example from HCP SDS or on-prem SDS/ESP), we?€?ll be able to say that BOC is IoT ?€?compliant?€?.

Here below some other names of customers, interested in this functionality ?€? IoT, streaming of data being pushed to a dashboard:

Siemens (from Paul Brownsey):

""Siemens is setting up the SAP Cloud Connector and the SAC Agent and enabling data import from on-premise file server(s). They would like to ensure that different SAC users/teams can access different on-premise files, based on permissions assigned to them.

At the moment, the security context whereby on-premise files are accessed by SAC users is determined by the user that starts the Tomcat process. Depending on the customer's Tomcat setup, this might be the Windows system user, a Windows domain user account that starts Tomcat as a service, or the user that executes startup.bat for Windows or startup.sh for Linux. All SAC users access files via the connection using this same security context.

SAC administrators can already include a folder path as part of each connection definition (presumably in either UNC or UNIX formats?). Presumably this prevents a user who is creating models from the connection from accessing files outside of the specified folder (even if whitelisted in the Tomcat configuration). The problem, then, is that such connections are currently private to the admin who creates them, and there's as-yet no way to share each connection with a different audience. So one of the following features would be required:

Ability to organize and secure connections in folders (FPA00-9873)
Ability to share file server connections with other users & teams
An alternative could be to allow SAC users to log on to the file server (like they log on to other data source connections) by supplying user/domain credentials when creating a model. Pass those credentials all the way through to the on-premise file server. And implement connection-sharing workflows ?€? with and without credentials ?€? consistent with other data import connections in SAC. <= this would be required if the customer expected existing on-premise folder/file permissions to be respected. We did not explicitly discuss this point with Siemens, but it didn't sound like that was the case.

The desired run-up chart is a stacked bar chart with one bar for each fiscal period such that the first bar displays the P01 actual value for gross costs, the second bar displays the sum of the actual values for P01 and P02, and so on until the fifth bar, which displays the sum of the actual values for P01 up to P05. The sixth bar shows the same sum and stacked on top of that in a different color, the forecast value for P06, the seventh bar still shows the same sum of actual values and stacked on top the sum of the forecasts for P06 and P07 and so forth until the twelveth bar which shows the sum of the actual values for P01 - P05 and stacked on top, the sum of forecast values for P06 - P12.??

The the current version of the report with an imported data model, this is realised as follows. Starting from the gross costs measure, we create two restricted measures ""Act gross costs"" and ""FC gross costs"" that restrict gross costs to the actual and forecast versions, respectively. These two measures are added as measures to a stacked bar chart. Furthermore, we add the time dimension displaying the periods of the current Siemens fiscal year. We then create a cross calculation ""Run-up"" as restriction of the account measures based on the time dimension with the Year-to-Date option. This produces the desired output.

Siemens asks for the same solution to work also when using a corresponding model based on live data.

Some extra points to consider:
 * Adding the version dimension to the ""color"" of the chart and using the Year-to-Date restriction on the base measure ""Gross cost"" does not produce the desired outcome. For periods P06 - P12, only the sum of the forecast values will be displayed, but not the actual values, as for P06 - P12, no actual values are given (In my mind, this is a strange and inconsistent behavior).
 * The obvious alternative approach would be to do the Year-to-Date calculation in the S4 backend. However, implementing this with CDS views is very cumbersome and produces performance issues. Moreover, it does not align with the SAC pretension of being a easy-to-use self-service tool operateable by business users.",1,1

The Blending issue is same in SAC as well. Below is the description: 

Apply a filter on a linked dimension from the secondary and it doesn?€?t get applied on the blended viz, as this was the secondary datasource participating in the blending.

Proposed scenario:
-	Anytime a user implements a filter or input control, it applies against the member dimension in ALL linked / blended datasets and stories.

Current scenario:
-	When a user implements a page filter / Input control , it only applies against visualizations where the filter is in the primary dataset.

 System checks the thresholds defined. If the heatmap value is very close to lower value then the hue should be very light and the closer it is on the higher value the darker should be the hue.

As Table details are hidden at Porsche and the end-users are told not to work with the context menu, end-users immediately ran into inconsistencies, as they have accidentally hidden a row, then saw, that something was missing/wrong, but couldn't get it back, as they nowhere saw what they did, so they accessed the story again which resets what they did.

This said, there should be an option to hide functionality in combination with hidden elements of the context menu. An option like introduced in app design (see screenshot) where one can set the context menu visible /invisible with the additional option to select or deselect functions would be really helpful.

________________________________________

*Added KAESER Requirement on 28.08.2019:*

KAESER Kompressoren requires a Time Series Chart, which allows the display of min. two Measures in a Time Series Chart at the same time. This is already??possible, but the scale of the axis is set, based on the lowest and highest value for all Measures in the Chart. It is always the case, that you need to display two or more measures, where the value ranges differ a lot (e.g. lower single-digit values and values in the upper 10.000s). As the chart is required for analysis of IoT data (1 data point each 10 to 30s), it is important to make visual analysis of those measures in a single chart. With the current chart it is not possible to??work with the content in the chart, because the gradient of the data??for the lower-range values (only changing +- 0.5) are flattened so strong, that it is basically displayed as a flat line.??

Using a Line Chart is not an option, because of the limitation in data points and the high-resolution of the source data.
Please provide either one of the following for the Time Series Chart:

1) [preferred] Dynamic Measure Scaling for multiple measures as an selectable option Each measure should be scaled to use 100% of the height to??make the gradient of the series data clear enough. Upon a selection of a line / data point, the axis should adjust the value range. This is a commonly used behavior of a 2D Time Series Chart for IoT data. Please see the screenshot from the SAP PdMS Chart attached.

2)??Dual Axis Support (like in the Line Chart): You can define a measure for the Y1 (Left) and Y2 (Right) Axis.??This would only work if two measures are required. We already know that there are cases where 3 measures with a different value range are required.",2,1

1. We have observed in customer projects that one of the biggest pain points is the deployment and configuration of reverse proxy for live on-prom HANA connections, and this leads to high TCO for customers.

2. Reverse proxy also causes strong side effects for the authentication to the SAML 2 IdP. For example, X509 certificate authentication against SAML 2 IdPs cannot happen due to SSL termination on the reverse proxy. 

3. With Direct/CORS support for HANA connection, we can remove the need for setting up a reverse proxy. This has not been supported to date, partially because that CORS does not work well with SAML SSO.

4. Many customers do not have SAML 2 IdPs in their landscape, but they want to authenticate to HANA in an automated fashion, such as client certificate authentication and Kerberos/SPNego.

The requirement
1. Support CORS for live on-prem HANA connection.
2. Support direct authentication to HANA with the direct/CORS connection to HANA. This would allow Client Certificate authentication and Kerberos authentication to happen.",1,1
Explorer - Search Across Facets/Dimensions in Data View,FPA34-634,3286458,User Story,Backlog,FPA34,High,D068218,,,11/10/2016 1:09,4/20/2021 7:41,9/29/2022 9:53,,,,"BI (Charts, Explorer, Geo, Input controls, etc.)",,,,,,,"*Added information (Nov 15, 2019):*

??

As a casual user of the SAP Analytics Cloud Explorer functionality, I want to use the search option, allowing me to search across all dimension facets that are visible in my Explorer View and across all measures that are part of my Explorer view. The search will allow me to quickly highlight those marching records and matching dimension members that are matching my search request. Based on the highlighting in my Explorer View I can then decide if I would like to filter my data down to the highlighted elements.

The system will also provide me with an option to confirm the result for the search, which then would filter down all dimensions and measure to the resultset of the search.

??

*Example* :??

(screenshots reflect SAP BusinessObjects Explorer existing workflows)
 * User Jake is launching SAP Analytics Explorer
 * System presents to User Jake the dimension facets, the measure facet, and the corresponding dimension members, measure members, and visualization.
 * User Jake is navigating to the search option in SAP Analytics Explorer
 * User Jake is entering the following search term:
 ** sales revenue for 2016 Q1 in New York for blue products??
 * See attached screenshot ""Explorer_015.jpg"" for the example resultset from SAP BusinessObjects Explorer.
 * User Jake has now the option to either select any of the highlighted dimension members or to use the resultset from the search as new data set for the Exploration??

??

*Expected Behavior*
 * Any dimension facet that has a positive result for the search will be moved to the ""front"" of the list of facets
 * All dimension facets with a positive result for the search will be sorted based on the total measure value matching the search question
 ** In the screenshot, dimension State moved to the far front because state New York has the highest value matching the search criteria
 * any matching dimension member or measure will be highlighted as part of the facets
 * The highlighting (background color, font color) should be configurable
 * User should have the following two options when the search result is being highlighted
 ** Option #1: The user can select any of the highlighted members in the dimension facets and the selected member would then be used either as an include or exclude (depending on facet configuration) filter value
 ** Option #2: The SAC Explorer UI will provide an option to click a single button, which then will act as a type of confirmation that the highlighted members across all dimensions will be use and Explorer will then use the resultset of the search to continue.
 * The search will automatically go across all dimensions and measures that have been included into the view.
 * In case the user is selecting one of the highlighted dimension members, we should keep the highlighting of the dimension members in the other facets.
 ** for example:
 *** User Jake selects the entry New York for facet State
 *** The highlighted entries will still be highlighted - for example for facet Store Name (see attached image Explorer_019.jpg)
 *** When user Jake clears the text from the search box - then the highlighting will be cleared as well?? (see attached image Explorer_020.jpg)
 *** In addition, when the search text is cleared, the sort order of the dimension facets is being restored to the original order

Within the Data View in a Story, a user can only currently do a search within each Facet/Dimension when searching for a specific field. A global level search function across all Facets/Dimensions would be extremely helpful.

I've attached a few images displaying potential ways that this functionality could exist within BOC. A simple search box that is located on the Data View options banner would suffice for this type of functionality.",1,1

This is a problem as there might have been a problem with the BW update, or a problem with the data load caused by an issue with SAP ANALYTICS CLOUD Agent. There are other times when the data load might fail, for example if the user goes on holiday and the password expires.

Calculation - Request for Real time Advanced Formula/script with scope determined by what was submitted by planner ,FPA34-2531,5035766,User Story,Open,FPA34,High,D065043,I822313,I822313,7/5/2018 16:01,3/25/2021 23:06,9/29/2022 9:53,,,,"BI (Charts, Explorer, Geo, Input controls, etc.)","Planning (Allocations, VDT, etc.)",,,,,,"This requirement is to allow Advanced Formulas/script to run in real-time, smart enough to detect that the user has input Plan data and determining the scope from the submit.    To the user, this results in ""real-time"" calculations - just like dimension formulas - and the user does not need to run a batch process after inputting plan data.

SAC Advanced Formulas (""script"") allow calculations to generate data from other data within SAC.  Currently, these Data Actions are only usable if the user manually executes a Data Action after submitting data in ""batch mode"".

In planning world, customers require same action in real-time, so that a trigger or data action is not required.  The scope of the action is generally determined by the plan data the user submitted.

For example, assume a Advanced Fromula script sets Revenue = Price x Volume with the idea being the user submits Price and Volume to generate plan Revenue (ignore the fact for now this requirement could possibly met by a dimension formula, as this is an over-simplification for now).

Currently in SAC, a user would submit Price and Volume   =>  and Revenue would be calculated by the script in batch mode, likely against every Profit center, every Company Code, and the entire time planning horizon based on memberset determined by the script owner.

The preferred solution would be that the calculation of Revenue would be triggered anytime a user input Price or Volume into a designated Planning category.  Also, if the user input Price or Volume against March and April 2018 only, against Profit Center AAA and BBB only, then the calculation would only run on Profit Center AAA and BBB, March/April 2018, and only re-generate Revenue in those profit centers and time periods.   This user-based scope is dynamic and will also help performance at user level.

There often will be use cases where the scope of what was submitted by users needs to be expanded in the script so that the proper calculation is made.  For example,  if a user inputs Cash Balance into Feb 2018, the script may need to expand the scope to prior month Jan 2018 because it needs to run a carry-forward operation in real time.   This requirement leads to the need for an ADDMEMBERSET command to add members to a memberset in scope.   

We have examples of ""real-time"" scoping script from BPC Std NW world in SFP model and GH Kim has access if you want us to walk you through examples.

In BPC Standard NW, this real time logic is known as Default Logic.  From SAP documentation:  ""Default logic is a special logic statement that is executed on every writeback to a model. All logic in Default.LGF is run after data sends. Data is first committed to the model and then, Default.LGF is run on model data.""     Please check with GH Kim as I am certain he is aware of the capabilities of Default Logic.",1,1
Content usage tracking and automated rearrangement based on past and peer group usage,FPA34-2562,5091982,Epic,Open,FPA34,Medium,I055049,D047313,D047313,7/23/2018 6:50,3/24/2021 16:58,9/29/2022 9:53,,,,Developer/APIs,,,,,,,"By using eye tracking in combination with behavioral feedback, it is possible to understand the information needs of the recipient and thus provide individualized reporting structures and visualizations.

*Long-term vision:* Eye tracking and click behavioral feedback is used to rearrange single components (charts, tables, sections?€?) within a report. Components that are used/looked at more often are displayed at first, components that are not looked at are not displayed any more.

*Short-term vision:* Click behavioral feedback is used to rearrange pages and components. Pages or components that are clicked more often are displayed at first, pages and components that are not used at all will be cut out.

*In a role of a report consumer*, I would like to have a tailored report that only displays the information I really need. A report is a subset of a large dashboard, considering the time I was looking at the report pages in the past to have quicker access to the information I am interest-ed in without many navigation steps. The information I need should be highlighted or rear-ranged in a way, which is easy to consume for me. Reports that are not especially relevant for me or unnecessary should be moved to the end of my report story or even be deleted. With this I am able to take faster decisions and for which a have more evidence.

*In a role of a report creator*, I would like to have continuous feedback from the report consumer. This is regarding the pages, charts or texts, how they are arranged and how the information is structured as well as where the user wants to have optimizations implemented. I also would like to have an intelligent system that removes unnecessary reports to keep the reporting library up to date. It helps to adapt the order of reporting content to the reading behavior of users and provide them with personalized reports. Being supported by systems means to easily understand the recipient?€?s needs for information. I also would like to analyze the usage data to implement ongoing report monitoring to reduce effort for maintenance that saves costs.
 PwC?€?s interest is to develop an own Reporting 5.0 solution (using SDK or similar) within the SAC environment, where companies can choose between one or more features out of the Reporting 5.0 SDK feature set. So, reading out the raw usage tracking data and using it to arrange components/stories by API are one important part. 
 Additionally it is important not only tracking the hits per page, but also per tile to monitor charts, etc. for example and how often there was a drill-down, etc. The data needs to be accessible as raw-data so the report creator can investigate and retrace why charts may have been not be as meaningful as designed.
 Furthermore it is also key to have the possibility to analyze, which filters have been used by which user (story/page filter) so all interactions between the user and the report are recorded. For example, if one specific user always filters on a certain region as a first action, other regions may only be hardly interesting for the user. Based on this information, the report can be tailored to the user??s needs.

*How does the standard SAC Usage Tracking functionality support this?*
 * Shipped with Wave 2018.17
 * Basic functionalities for user tracking
 * 4 pre-defined models:
 ** Usage Other objects:
 *** Measures counts of creators, object dependencies or a count of objects which then can be analyzed for example by user, timestamps or modification dates
 ** Usage files:
 *** Measuring count of objects/creator that can be deeper investigated with file related data, like modification time, object ID, descriptions, file ID/type or parent folder (ID)
 ** Usage activities:
 *** Points out the count of activities by user/object ID or date. It would be helpful to not only be able to analyze the object types, but also the names of stories/boardrooms
 ** Usage users:
 *** Helps to analyze the count of roles, teams or users by name or ID

??-> Basically, this functionality is heading in the right direction, but for a tailored analysis it is key to have less generic data models

-> As there are only counts of objects/creators/activities displayed high-level analysis like who is actually using the system extensive/rarely are possible. This is already a very good information to see, if all users are really touching the system. To have a close-to-report analysis, also information about visited stories, pages and charts are required. As a proposal they may be added under the ?€?Usage files?€? section, as there are already hierarchies for folders and documents are applied

-> Additionally it would be great to have all this data in one data model to simplify processes and to make it easier for the report creator to build up tailored reports

In the case of SAP sources, we can provide a better experience as we are then expecting a certain format from the output, and we also need to know if the OData is on-premise to go through SCC. For generic OData sources, do not check any of the boxes as they are not mandatory.

Access to Node level selections when loading S4HC transaction data,FPA34-2455,4947227,User Story,Considered,FPA34,Low,D035331,I822313,I822313,6/9/2018 0:02,2/22/2021 11:43,9/29/2022 9:53,,,,"BTP, HANA, Fiori Integration",,,,,,,"This request is for Transaction data load.  A related JIRA ticket 2456 is for master data load.  See link below.

When loading Transaction data into a SAC replicated model from S4HC, customers need to be able to limit the data volume by being allowed to make node level selections of what transaction data to bring in.

Since bringing the Master Data into SAC from S4HC in a pre-requisite for Transaction data, we know the node definitions already exists in SAC, so we need access the hierarchy/node when importing Transaction data.

For G/L account this leads to requirements like:

?€?I wish to load Net Income into my Finance model?€?
?€?I wish to load Revenue into my Sales model?€?
?€?I wish to load Opex into my Project model?€?
""I wish to load Employee Expense into my Workforce model""  - see example interface GLAccount__TD_Node.PNG

When I load from node level(s), that means I get that base level children/members that fall under that node.  I may end up selecting more than one node.  For example, in a headcount model, I may ask for the Salary node, the Benefits node, and the Bonus node.  Or, I might take advantage of just loading an ""Employee Expense"" load, which is in the example GLAccount__TD_Node.PNG below.


What happens today which is very poor modeling and integration experience AND result:
Today, I need to load every single account when loading transaction data.  I can filter to attributes but the attributes are not at the right level as the definition of what I need is at the node level!    Again, as an example, in a Sales model, I only want to load the base level members of Revenue node.  In a Workforce model, I only need Employee-related expenses from S4HC (see GLAccount__TD_Node.PNG).

I surely don't need the Revenue nodes or the Balance Sheet nodes or any other non-employee related expense nodes in a Workforce model, but there is no way for me to control those across the five underlying jobs today without individual selection.


Background:

This requirement goes back to 4Q 2016 and we thought this requirement was going to be addressed in S4HC.  It was not so I am logging it in SAC.  If SAC thinks S4HC should contribute to this requirement, then we should leverage this JIRA to start that discussion with S4HC team because it is SAC users/customers that are impacted.",1,1

How would this work for Aflac ? Also, I suspect they use it to analyze Google Analytics and DoubleClick given the context. Is that correct ? Any additional context you could provide ?

Paul,
 
Aflac?€?s marketing team is loving the BOC/DiBo platform but wondering if we plan to have any direct connections to Google Big Query / Google Analytics / Google Double Click.  Big Query would cover all of them but adds a step in the process.  Direct connect to Double Click and Google Analytics would be preferred.

Report Design???
The report has Department1,Department2 in the row and unbooked data enabled. 

Current situation:
When userA open the report, Department1 and Department2 are displayed. So for department2, UserA still can edit the cell and type the data(even userA cannot send the data to Department2 ).

Issue caused 
Users spend a lot of time to enter data, but unfortunately found the data is lost when publish because they don't have the write access. 

Customer's need:
They just want to the user only can do the planning for their own department.

What Enhancement being request:
When unbooked data is enabled, only the writable member displayed. 

The behavior will be the following if enhancement delivered.
When userA open the report, only Department1 is displayed on the report because userA only has write access to Department1.

Basic requirement is:
 
?€?	Board member is in a meeting powered by SAC with E-Quill by their side on their iPad.
?€?	They see a story / set scene in SAC, and want to check something privately (they see an aggregate of all budgets in SAC?€?what about my budgets?)
?€?	Head of operations writes ?€?show budgets for Operations?€? in E-Quill
?€?	Boom. We need to construct the relevant query for what they wrote. For that we need to have a connection to SAC which tells us all the stories which are currently being displayed in SAC. IDs, link to, whatever. Basically the state of SAC at that moment in time.
?€?	We then use that info to construct the query to filter for ?€?operations?€? in SAC.
?€?	We display the results of that query in E-Quill. We?€?ve done that. But we need to know the basics of what system / what?€?s being displayed to do that.
 
So in essence, we need a hook into SAC which lets us understand:
 
a)	The system config / setup of the underlying SAC powering SAC
b)	A push notification with identifiers of stories and the underlying queries that power what is being shown right then in SAC. We can use that to then modify / target queries.

The idea of this mobile SAC/Wechat integration is receiving SAC notification in Wechat and process the planning task. As the below screenshot 1,2,3 , receiver will receive the input task process notification in Wechat. Opening with the detailed input task in Wechat, receiver could review the input task notification and even give ?€?Approve?€? and ?€?Reject?€? command based on input description (screenshot 4).

Task assignees should input detailed budget plan on PC instead of mobile, so here is just receiving notification and processing simple approval command on Mobile Wechat.

??

So APIs that may need for this scenario
 # API for notification:??

How to push the message to the external system after the SAC workflow starts, is there any related API or method or implementation mechanism?
 # API to request login user?€?s input task list and task detail.
 # API to reject or approve input task.

??Are any of these APIs available or on the roadmap???

But in the SAC dialog to create new connections (and only this dialog... it works in search fields ad most other places) you cannot use this combination of keys to create the symbol.

Work-around is to open notepad and enter @ in there. Then copy-paste it to the field in SAC where you need to enter @.

Sample use case: When creating a new connection in SAP Analytics Cloud, you often need to enter ""@"". For example to create an oData connection to Successfactors you have to enter username in the format ""user@instance"".

Get additional information from 3rd party data sources
Currently we show charts about the revenue and so on of the merchandising shops of TSG Hoffenheim.It might be quite interesting if you could combine these stored information (HANA Live datasource) with 3rd party information like soccer results or weather information, to see correlations between these facts.

2. Predictive use case
SAP Customer Checkout runs on HANA, so they have Live HANA data from the kiosk sales and onsite fan shop sales. They have the information about the sales date and want to enrich this data e.g. with weather information. Running a Bayesian network algorithm they want to detect the weather impact on e.g. ice cream or mulled wine sales to equip the kisoks with the right amount of ice cream of mulled wine based on the weather forecast for the next match.

3. Retrieve translations from a web service
In the SAP Customer Checkout system, a return code is stored for the case customers return a product, e.g. return code 10. The description of the return code is generic and can be defined by each customer individually. Customer A defines return code 10 as ?€?Product damaged?€?, Customer B defines return code 10 as ?€?Product was delivered to late?€?. For custom defined return codes translations are maintained in a property file. 
This property files should be retrievable via the API in Orca and joined to the HANA Live model to support story consumption in different languages.

As you see, all three use cases would need information from external web service (SOAP/REST)",2,1

SAP's 'Core Banking' solution is  very similar to S/4HANA on-premise - It uses the same architecture for analytics as S/4HANA OP. 
Core Banking is a NW750 SPS7 Netweaver-based solution which leverages ABAP-based authorizations for analytics, and uses ABAP CDS Views to expose data. 

However, Core Banking is not certified for use with SAC, which is a problem for the UK's Financial sector. 

1. Problem is, the NW kernel is on 750 SPS7 (not 7.51 SPS2 as listed for S4). What's are the Notes needed to take NW to the right release level?

Many of them never access stories directly, and this causing confusion (duplicate naming conventions for topics / stories, proliferation of folders for role control, etc). The executive users who have access to all the stories in the Boardroom are the same users who now have to sort through the largest folder trees!

Can we get a grouping for just Digital Boardroom (like on the old system)? Or maybe a simplified site for Digital Boardroom users that doesn't expose file structure or stories at all?

From [https://influence.sap.com/sap/ino/#/idea/209685]

Customer Suramericana has??a series of DiBos available for their executive users. During deployment their admin users??created content and then shared it to end users. End users then could access the DiBos but could not view the content in them, as they did not have access to the underlying stories and also did not have admin roles. The customer doesn't want to share direct access to underlying stories to the end users as this can add complexity in navigating files, also making these users admins isn't an option.

Ideally the customer wants users with DiBo access be able to view the content without needing access to the underlying stories. Considering an end user wouldn't have access to a DiBo if they weren't meant to be able to view the content in them, the current folder system is redundant and can affect our customer's ability to adopt the tool.

??

Customer (ExxonMobil) notes that the Exit button in DiBo leads to underlying folder structure. This causes end users to get lost and confused in navigation. Having a standalone grouping for DiBo so that end users cannot navigate outside of it would make more sense than exiting into file explorer.",1,1

As a user I would like to be able to have the possibility to create and manage versions of all objects in SAC and transport them between various systems easily. The main idea is that if somebody is working on a story/model/?€? has the option to easily create backup-versions before modification. This versioning feature must have an automatic creation of versions before objects are overwritten by any transport.
The user must be able to define which version is accessible for other users. ?€?Old?€? versions might be deleted after a dedicated time but need to be available for at least a couple of days.
Feature idea design
Select object for versioning ??? on top bar have the icon for creating versions. 
 
After clicking to get the window with versions, the box for inserting comments and a button for the possibility to create major version should come up. The numbering of subversions must be automatic.
 
Version history will be available after navigation to version number:
Version	Version date	Comment	Creator
1.0	1.1.2018	New start	Pavel Strnad
1.1	1.2.2018	Add new calculation	Pavel Strnad
1.2	1.3.2018	Before dilatation sales chart	Pavel Strnad
2.0	1.4.2018	Automatic version before transport xxx date x.x.x	Pavel Strnad

Top bar of history window should include buttons with this function:
1.	Return document to this version
2.	Crete new document with selected version to same destination
3.	Crete new version

Version management setup will be available in admin section.
Admin setup option  
Version management system ON/OFF
Version management system autocreation version during transport ON/OFF
How many version will keep history  ON/OFF (select number of day)

Transport management system 
Transport management system (TMS) give users easy option to migrate objects between environments.
TMS will have two ways how to transport. One way will be directly from content and second from deployment section. Any job can be run many times and it should be possible to edit this JOB in the deployment area.
Way from content
1.	Select object
2.	Click on icon for transport on top bar
 
3.	Generate automatic unique name of transport (system time object name with option to change this name) in standard transport location
4.	Select target system for migration (login to target system must be automatic)
 
5.	Select if you would like to include dependences (Model, Connection, Digital boardroom)

I'm from SET package build team. We are developing BOC contents (Stories, Models, DiBo, etc) for different industries. We are working together with Sieberg, Rolf and Eichmann, Guido. 

We have a question which need your help:
I tested the Import function in system, it shown all objects and also allows customer to select/de-select.  However, the system are not show which objects were already been changed by customer in their tenant, if BOC function can provide these kind of information, then it may easy for customer to decide which objects they want to overwrite, and which don?€?t. 

this function is important for us, because so far BOC product doesn't prevent customer to modify pre-delivered contents from technically, hence, it would be better if we can notice customer which objects they already changed, and let them choose which version they need - the modified version by themselves OR using the upgrading version to replace the old one. 

If you need more discussion, please feel free to contact me directly, we are very happy to support clarification of this requirements. 

thank you very much.

 There should be an option to display the aggregated value for each dimension member. This is from where business users start their analysis (high-level information) before they go into details.

Colour assignment for tuples of measures and dimension members is not currently configurable. Instead colours are assigned automatically and synchronized using the Color Sync feature.
h2. Goal(s)

As a user, it is desirable to:
 # Be able to control the colour, pattern and bar position applied to each tuple when you have a combination of N measures and k dimensions, where each dimension can have its own number of members
 # As the number of members can grow rapidly, it'll be important that the display and configuration of the tuples can scale (what is displayed and what is queried for) with large numbers of tuples

An example of this: 3 measures (Income Statement, Taxes and Net Revenue) and coloring by a dimension that has 3 members (Product filtered to Apparel, Footwear and Accessories) - resulting in 9 tuples/combinations (cross section between measure and dimension member).

Requirement 2: In the story, when users want to publish the data, expect two options:
 * 1) Publish and Done
 * 2) Publish.

The reason for option 1 is because users may forget to click done on the task(event) and also it will be more user friendly if the Done action can triggered from story.

we face an issue with a story filter on top of a linked dimension. The story consists of two models which are linked via a couple of dimensions. A filter on the linked dimension ""Top Event Series"" is applied as deafult filter of the story. The user does not see and does not know for which model the filter was applied. Trying to change the selection for ""Top Event Series"" and choosing the view for which the default filter was not defined, the story filter will be duplicated. See attached screenshots and video.
The expected behaviour would be that linked dimensions will only show up once in the filter pane. The applied filter should be visible in all models. For the user it should not make any difference in which model the filter is been set.

Today,??some filter settings are not using a time dimension, but the customer would like??to trigger a change of the filter value based on a specific date. For example, switch from??Version??_Actuals_??to??_Forecast 03_??at a specific date and back to??_Actuals_??some days later.?€?
A trigger-based filter would be very helpful to decrease the time to update the??configuration.

Expectation:?€?

I, as a story designer, would like to automatize a logic with which my filter values will update based on a??specific date.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Update from comments below:

Some filter settings are not using a time dimension but a time-based filter change.
 One scenario is the switch from Version??_Actuals_??to??_Forecast 03_??at a specific date and back to??_Actuals_??some days later.
 A trigger-based filter would be very helpful to decrease the time to update the configuration.

?€?

As a story creator, I would like to be able to configure a date (and time)-based change of the filter settings and/or a measure selection.

This would increase the efficiency at month/quarter change and would enable the following scenario at SAP.

On a specific day the data has to switch from Forecast to Version and the Quarter has to change from 2016-Q4 to 2017-Q1.
 Currently, this has to be changed chart by chart manually. For small contents with a small number of tiles, this can be updated manually.
 But at SAP's content with 20+ stories and 120+ widgets, this is not scalable.",1,1

When I am defining a restricted measure, I can use a Calculation Input Control for a Global Dimension. It can happen that I am using the same Global Dimension in another Model. Now I want to be able to create a Restricted Measure with a Calculation Input Control for the same Global Dimension. 
Currently this would cause me to have 2 Calculation Input Controls for the same Dimensions which is very ugly and cumbersome. 
To reproduce (Screenshots in Attachment):
1. Insert a chart based on a Model that has public dimensions  (Model 1). Create a new Calculation
2. Select Restricted Measure, Name it Model 1, Select a Measure, Select a public dimension, Click Create a new Calculation Input Control
3. Select Value for the Dimension
4. Name the Input Control Model 1
5. Insert a Chart based on a differnet model with the same public dimension (Model 2)
6. Create a New Calculation
7. Select Restricted Measure, Name it Model 2, Select a Measure, Select the same public Dimension. You will see that the previous Input Control is not there. Click create a new Calculation Input Control
8. Select Values for the Dimension
9. Name it Model 2
10. OK

Please describe your improvement request

Create a new option on any graph that currently has a Trellis option, but instead of performing its segmentation within the same tab, the first option would be to create additional tabs with the same format as the current tab only if the trellis was extended to so many screens I would like (n screens), or in which this functionality was only available at the digital boardroom level without having to create n tabs that instead the trellis works displaying the detail on each screen and will work as a kind of reel. I do not know if the idea is crazy...

What is the opportunity/problem the request will address?

 The problem we would solve is that in some cases to show the details in a digital boardroom, simply repeat the same graphics only with a different segmentation visualization, in the case of Webi the section does, at the SAC level it would be the Trellis , what we would need would be that this effect of Trellis only at the multi screen level and what we would help the user to achieve with this is a shorter construction time at the DiBo level and sooner a lesser use of unnecessary tabs at the level of the stories since the object would display tabs as many times as necessary or settling with a custom parameter making the Digital Boardroom edition more dynamic.

What is the expected benefit?

Customer requirement is to allow customers to navigate Digital Boardroom via voice.    The basic requirement is to allow a predefined URL to be launched from Digital Boardroom.  Basic filtering by voice command can also be considered.

This is related to integrating with SAP Co-Pilot, which supports voice recognition.  

User Scenario
1. User opens Digital Boardroom
2. Via voice command, chooses a navigation path in Boardroom, or opens another Boardroom.

I recommend doing this via Digital Boardroom API, so we can later integrate with voice activation tools like Alexa, Cortana or Siri if necessary.

A secondary, lower priority scenario is filtering content.  For example ""Show me North American sales"" and it automatically filters the content down.

One reason for using voice control instead of touch is you may be presenting on a non-touch enabled presentation screen.  So instead of using a mouse, you can use voice command.  But the set of available commands would need to be limited.

Additional Scenarios:
- Using voice command to change input controls
- Dictate memos

Situations, during which ppl want to use voice:
- Video wall
- Using DiBo on non-touch enabled systems
- Multiple screens",1,1

Customer is complaining about this behavior. In a multiscreen environment, when starting a meeting you start from the left screen and if you want to change a filter you need to go to the 3rd screen to change a filter and then come back to the left screen and so on if you want to change several times filters.

The request is to have the pop-up story filter window displayed on the screen where it was called from.?? Topic filters and story filters are related from a user perspective, and it will be confusing to the user if they are on different screens.

??More details from Cubic:

As a Digital Boardroom presenter, I want the story filter panel to open on the current screen i'm already interacting with charts on, so that I can avoid physically moving to the right-most screen where the story filter panel currently opens always before moving back to the left screen again to continue the presentation.

A presenter also has to drag a mouse pointer to the right most edge to interact with the story panel on a non-touchscreen DiBo setup.

Enable positioning of label close to horizontal indicator 
In the Key Performance Indicator section in the 'Overview' screen of the story, the indicator label (in this case, '% Cost Variance') does not display close to the horizontal indicator, instead, it displays far above it. For the SAP__MANU_GEN_PRODUCTCOST story, it was required to use a responsive page, which technically forbids overlapping. 

Dashboards like the SAP_TE_Dashboard are canvas based, allowing chart overlapping to present a visually appealing layout. As seen from the screenshots, there is good alignment and positioning of the above entities on the Overview page, possible due to overlapping components. Also, the width of the horizontal indicator utilizes the available empty space around it, unlike the indicator in the above story which appears compressed and leaves a lot of empty real estate around it.

There's no solution. You can't edit a model without that live connection being valid. If you can't edit a model you can't change the connection it uses.

So this enhancement is two things:
1) warn the user the connection they are about to delete has models and/or stories based off it. Preferable to prevent that connection from being deleted if any models are based off it.
2) allow to change a models connection even when the existing connection is not valid. (so allowing to correct the problem.

In social network, there is subscribe, and we will recieve the content we want, but in SAC, we HAVE TO recieve the content people want to share, without our agreement.

Is there any way to change this behavior?
For example, can we remove the 'all' option in share? If people want to share it with all the people, then they should move the content to public.

Also, can we have a option to reject the shared content?

Access to Node level selections when loading S4HC master data,FPA34-2456,4947233,User Story,Considered,FPA34,Low,D035331,I822313,I822313,6/9/2018 0:16,11/20/2019 14:47,9/29/2022 9:53,,,,"BTP, HANA, Fiori Integration",Data Integration,,,,,,"This request is for master data load.  A related JIRA ticket 2455 is for transaction data load.  See link below.

When loading Master data into a SAC replicated model from S4HC, customers need to be able to limit the master data selections in a model by being allowed to make node level selections of what master data to bring in.

We need access to the hierarchy/nodes when importing Master data, although we know this is a challenge based on how S4HC delivers master data with the hierarchy in more than one integration job for a single master data view.  But, the requirement is what it is.

For G/L account this leads to requirements like:

?€?I wish to load Net Income into my Finance model?€?
?€?I wish to load Revenue into my Sales model?€?
?€?I wish to load Opex into my Project model?€?
""I wish to load Employee Expense into my Workforce model""  - see sample UI GLAccount__TD_Node.PNG

When I load from node level(s), that means I get that Node, and child node, and the base level children/members that fall under the nodes.  I may end up selecting more than one node.  For example, in a Workforce model, I may ask for the Salary node, the Benefits node, and the Bonus node.  I may also just want to select one node and received all the nodes below it and base members -- see GLAccount__TD_Node.PNG.  

How it works today:
Today, I need to load every single node and member when loading master data, unless I select individual rows one-by-one.   I can filter to attributes but the attributes are not at the right level as the definition of what I need is at the node level!    Again, as an example, in a Sales model, I only want to load the Revenue node, any node under it, and any based level member under the nodes. 

In the Workforce model, I need to select the Employee expense node (see GLAccount__TD_Node.PN and all the child nodes and members would come in). I surely don't need the Revenue nodes, non-employee expense, or the Balance Sheet nodes or any other non-employee related expense nodes.

Remember, it takes 5 jobs to load master data hierarchical data from S4HC.   Today, there is no way to coordinate the selection of nodes and members across those five jobs.    But, customers need this.

As of July 2018, S4HC team was not commiting to this so we created an SAC specific solution as follows:

====SAC standalone solution for sample scenario=========
-Requirement is we need:
     -S4HC P&L & BS accounts in a SAC FINANCE model (but customer may want P&L only, or Revenue only etc)
     -S4HC Employee Expense accounts in a SAC WORKFORCE model

Steps to achieve this - See SAChub_Node.jpg

Step 1:  Load all accounts into one dimension (takes 5 jobs to do this from S4HC) - this is S4HC=>SAC
?€?	?€?Global_Account_S4HC?€? in the staging SAC Hub, or simply a Public dimension that brings in all S4HC master data and can be used now to build other dimensions.  This dimension is NOT used in any model.

Step 2:   Load all P&L/BS accounts into - this is SAC=>SAC
?€?	?€?Finance_Account_S4HC?€? in Finance with P&L and BS only based on definition of P&L and BS now available in SAC in ?€?Global_Account_S4HC?€?
- See UI example S4HC Load 2 Finance.jpg for selection screen for user

Step 3:  Load all Employee Expense accounts into - this is SAC=> SAC
?€?	?€?Workforce_Account?€? in Finance with Employee Expenses only based on definition of EE expenses now available in SAC in ?€?Global_Account_S4HC?€?
- See UI example S4HC Load 3 Workforce.jpg for selection screen for user


Background:
This requirement goes back to 4Q 2016 and we thought was going to be addressed in S4HC.  It was not so I am logging it in SAC.  If SAC thinks S4HC should contribute to this requirement, then we should leverage this JIRA to start that discussion with S4HC colleagues  because it is SAC users/customers that are impacted.",1,1

Hi Serena,
 
we are looking forward that SAP Analytics Cloud supports oData Version 3 and Version 4.
I saw that the User-Story (https://sapjira.wdf.sap.corp/browse/FPA00-4362) regarding this issue is assigned to you.
 
In your User-Story it is questioned to support oData V3 or not.
 
Mendix is a low-code-platform and Partner of SAP since last year October.
At the moment we are developing Apps on the Mendix Platform for purposes like resource planning etc. and would like to build an SAC Dashboard on top of the planning data by using live data connection via oData.
However, Mendix currently only supports oData Version 3 and therefore we would really appreciate it, if you could enable oData V3 on SAC.

as discussed with [~i050874] and [~i824430] in SACedia here https://jam4.sapjam.com/feed/item/RceMC6JgCKjhy84uP5wZRs

the new import refresh status panel nicely displays all former refresh activities including time, resulting status and duration. But the import duration perceived by the user is 30 times higher, i.e 10mins vs. 20 Seconds in our case (see screenshot), so the displayed information is missleading.

Serena: ""Currently the duration is measuring the time between when DA java service starts to execute the data query until the query response from external data service is received and processed within the DA java service. It doesn't include the round trip between Java service and ORCA HANA systems, and it doesn't include the round trip between browser and ORCA HANA systems. We could change what's been measured to be more consistent with user perceived duration""

Our request is, to change the approach accordingly and measure the end-to-end execution time, as preceived by the user.

Steps to Duplicate:	
1. Create a HANA view with an optional input parameter of type NVARCHAR(26) that has a default value as an expression: leftstr(string(now()),26). Add a calculated expression which returns the value of this input parameter.
2. Create a model in PF which consumes this HANA view
3. Do not set a value for this prompt (remove the default value that is displayed at design time).
4. Schedule the task.
You will see that the value of the calculated expression is the default value as displayed in the UI when creating the task, not the value at runtime.

Observed Behaviour: Predictive Factory retrieves the default value when creating a task and uses this value when executing the task => I cannot ask for using the default value as of the time of running the task.

Currently, for optional parameters, when a field is left empty in the UI, it is not interpreted as I do not want to set this prompt. The UI or the kernel will inject the default value when defined.

The old workflow was:
1 - Customer notices a problem in a widget and reports it to the partner.
2 - The partner troubleshoots the problem and suspects that something might 3 - be amiss in the SDK framework.
4 - The Partner raises an OSS ticket
5 - OSS ticket languished in primary support for weeks.
6 - Eventually it makes its way to the dev team and can be resolved.

Step 5 was the problematic step.  The primary support colleagues have no SDK development knowledge and could not contribute to actually solving the problem.  They only served to delay the resolution of the problem.  In the Lumira SDK postmortem interviews, this was a common partner complaint.

Two possible solutions:

We bypass primary support entirely on SDK related topics.  This would not be scalable with a large number of partners, but would work if the number of partners is below a certain quorum.  
-or-
Someone with SDK knowledge is added t the primary support team.  This would only make sense if the quorum has been reached, but if it has; then this would be the better long term approach.

We could start with an SDK OSS component and a primary support bypass protocol and then onboard an SDK primary support colleague.",1,1

There is also currently no automated data relationships (i.e. Data type detection, ID, Descriptions, Attributes, Hierarchies, Scaling Factor, Decimal Formatting) built into modeling, it is all done manually during model creation. If metadata is available, for instance in BW, ERP, OData etc, can we reduce customer requirement to interfere with the modeling process and further automate using the metadata already available to determine relationships and data types?

To expand on this, if any data is structured and metadata is known, can we create a mechanism to just push large data volumes into SAC without even having to go through the modeling process?

The objective of Reporting 5.0 is to make management reporting more efficient, insightful and relevant by automating reporting processes end to end with a bundle of new (SAC) technologies. The concept of R5.0 includes?€?4?€?main ideas/areas:?€???
 * *Personal Report:*?€?Eye tracking and click behavioral feedback?€?is used?€?to understand the information needs of each user and so rearrange single?€?components (charts, tables, sections?€?) within a report.?€?Components that are used/looked at more often are displayed at?€?first,?€?components that are not looked at are not displayed any more.?€???
 * *Q&A Bot:*?€??€?R5.0 wants to use a Knowledge Graph and NLP (natural?€?language processing) to enrich the ?€?Search to insight?€? SAC functionality, so you the report developer can predefine possible questions in advance and the report consumer can questions?€?siri-like using a microphone.?€???
 * *Simulating & Forecasting:* Reporting 5.0 wants to include internal and external data to enrich the Smart Discovery functionality. Furthermore, it shall be accessible by the Q&A Bot feature.?€??€???
 * *Insight to Action:* Making exports / collaborations possible for external calendar or project management tools (Outlook etc.)?€???

Within the SAP Digital Boardroom, Usage Tracking has been??implemented??as??PoC. This information can be displayed on a page??and also??the clicking order by the user can be shown. The leading questions here??are:??What are the most important pages and which could be left out? Which order the user chooses, so which information should be??displayed first???

??*Q&A Bot:* [SAPPHIRE 2017 PoC|https://sap.sharepoint.com/:v:/r/teams/PwCCollaboration/Shared%20Documents/General/PwC-02_Q_A%20Bot.mp4?csf=1&e=ZX9b4F]

With smart insights / smart discovery the key influencer for a measure / KPI can be displayed (Which effect does the advance purchase group [upfront booking time for flight tickets] have on my ticket price?)????

Additionally there are insights provided in a ?€?natural language?€? (XYZ percent of all entries are above average).??

With Smart Discovery the data??can be analyzed??in even more details like the combination advance purchase group and airline (In case of Lufthansa, the user discovers that the ticket price gets less, if he books later). All key influencer??can be??selected??and the simulation can be started, e.g. changing the advance purchase group, so the flight price will change??

*Insight to Action:* [SAPPHIRE 2017 PoC|https://sap.sharepoint.com/:v:/r/teams/PwCCollaboration/Shared%20Documents/General/PwC-04_Insight_to_Action.mp4?csf=1&e=k8nqty]

When the user has finished analyzing the data, he/she can use??Ruum??as a collaboration tool (PoC implementation).??Ruum??is kind of an internal project management tool where, for example, colleagues can be added and contribute to the dashboard in question. With??Ruum, screenshots??can be added, tasks can be created??and allocated or documents can be shared.??Also??there is a timeline provided and tasks can be tracked.??

 ** Using?€?the existing?€??€?Search to insight?€??€?SAC?€?plugin, questions of the client can be read out and content of the question library is searched and offered next to standard SAC answers?€???
 ** Long term approach is offering natural language processing instead Plugin that transfers the question to Search to Insight?€???
 * Features SDK component??Simulating & Forecasting?€???
 ** Q&A Bot functionality is available to enrich Smart Discovery??
 ** External date (e.g. from the internet) can be used to enhance smart discovery??

Subject: Re: Export Size
 
I just had one of my ?€?Lumira SDK Postmortem?€? interviews with a partner in Australia and he had two very interesting observations here. 
 
1 ?€? He builds a lot of ?€?Fiori?€? applications, where the end user is in Fiori and then opens an app from the BIP  What he is doing now is building Lumira Designer ?€?components?€? that are really entire UI5 applications and the Lumira app is just this single component.  It is kind of a dirty hack, but appears seamless to the end user.  If we?€?re serious about a platform play for SAC, he would very much like the ability to integrate SAC data into native Fiori apps. 
 
2 ?€? He mentioned that there is a perception among partners that SAC is closed.  This second point is important, because a perception that our platform is closed can hurt adoption; especially is a competitor can weaponize that perception.

Import of a Story with Model-More Options,FPA34-2090,4662612,User Story,Open,FPA34,Medium,D052181,D066536,D066536,3/12/2018 15:13,10/2/2019 18:43,9/29/2022 9:53,,,,,,,,,,,"Hello Team,

when we import a story we have the following options: 
-Update existing object
-import data only
-Drop dependent objects

However we would appreciate to have an option like: ""Create a copy of the Objects"". For example, if we have a story and model named ""mystory"" and ""mymodel"" in the tenant, when we import these again in the same tenant again a ""mystory_2"" and a ""mymodel_2"" should be created. 

We basically are thinking of a way to replicate a story we created on a dev system and then change the connection behind the story to prod. We only have one tenant where we have two different connections: dev and prod. We create a story on dev and when everything works well, we want to REPLICATE it along with the model and change the connection to Prod. Since we cannot replicate story along with a live model this could be done if we export and reimport the story and give the story and the model a new name. Then we could change the connection behind the second model. Can something like this be supported? OR do you have a better approach on how to replicate a story based on dev connection and connect it then to prod on the same tenant?

Another option would be to create a second model based on prod connection, copy the story and change the datasource behind the story from DEV-MODEL to PROD-MODEL. However changing the datasource behind a story destroys a lot of styling elements of a chart, plus it needs to be done for each chart separately.

Any suggestions? 

Thank you very much.

With best regards

The objective of Reporting 5.0 is to make management reporting more efficient, insightful and relevant by automating reporting processes end to end with a bundle of new (SAC) technologies. The concept of R5.0 includes 4 main ideas/areas:??
 * Personal Report:??Eye tracking and click behavioral feedback is used to understand the information needs of each user and so rearrange single components (charts, tables, sections?€?) within a report. Components that are used/looked at more often are displayed at first, components that are not looked at are not displayed any more.??

 * Q&A Bot:????R5.0 wants to use a Knowledge Graph and NLP (native language processing) to enrich the ?€?Search to insight?€? SAC functionality, so you the report developer can predefine possible questions in advance and the report consumer can questions??siri-like using a microphone.??
 * Simulating & Forecasting: Reporting 5.0 wants to include internal and external data to enrich the Smart Discovery functionality. Furthermore, it shall be accessible by the Q&A Bot feature.????
 * Insight to Action: Making exports / collaborations possible for external calendar or project management tools (Outook??etc.)??

*Use Case*????

??As an Analytics Hub business user:??
 * I want to have access to all reports in my company that I am authorized on??
 * I want to get access to additional Reporting 5.0 functionality, so that I benefit for instance from optimally arranged assets according to my interests:??
 ** Only relevant reports are displayed for me
 ** Alerts within reports can be displayed on hub level
 ** Q&A Bot is accessible already on hub level to search information through reports??
 ** I have access to my personal assistant (Insight to action), e.g. collaborating with my project team on hub level

As an Analytics Hub tenant administrator/content creator:??
 * I want to see in detail what reports are used and how they are used??to collect insights about the adoption. Relevant information could be:??
 ** How many times have reports been clicked / looked??on??asset??description??
 ** How intense recommended reports are used (in comparison to normal overview)??

As??a??SAP partner:??
 * I want to access usage data for SAC stories/dibos??that are listed in Analytics Hub using an interface. Usage data can be (for example):??
 ** which reports have been opened (also for non-SAC related reports)
 ** how long does the user stay in one??story??
 ** what does the user within one story??

 * I want to apply my own logic to the data and use the outcome to optimize the user experience in Analytics Hub. This can be:
 ** an optimized asset arrangement??
 ** My own sorting logic (e.g. involving external??data)...??

 * I want to deliver full Reporting 5.0 functionality for SAC based reports and only reduced functionality for non-SAC reports. This will also enable stronger integration with SAC.??

How painful is the current solution:

As of now, each user sees the same order of the assets within Analytics Hub?€?s all asset tab. In addition, in the home page tab, predefined sections by the tenant operator are equal to all users. A smart logic that suggests the business user what s/he might be interested in is beneficial. Thus, a functionality that takes the usage behavior of users into account to define the order or the content of sections automatic and on individual basis will increase user experience.??

*Use Case ?€? Simulation and Forecast*

In the future, it will become increasingly important not only to analyze the actual situation, but also to be able to make decisions on the basis of forecasts and predictions. Moreover, the comparison of different future simulations on the basis of different management decisions and key influencers will be crucial for successful corporate management.

*Use case short term:* Use Smart Discovery, a powerful feature within SAP Analytics Cloud that uses Machine Learning, to explore your data and uncover valuables insights. Discover the key influencers driving your KPIs and use them to analyze patterns in your data and predict future outcomes from historical data in different 'what-if' scenarios.

*Use case long term:*??The integrated forecasting and simulation feature can combine internal and external data. Simulations of different scenarios based on the development of internal or external KPIs or varying growth rates defined by the users are performed directly within the report. These value-adding simulations and forecasts are based on advanced analytics and machine learning technology, so you can make the right decisions faster.

??

*User Story*

*As a business user:* I want to be able to simulate the development of KPIs on the fly. E.g. while looking at a monthly report, I would like to select the Actuals and forecast them until the end of the year, comparing them to the budget. The underlying model takes key value and cost drivers into account and delivers multiple ?€?what-if?€? scenarios. This could either be done by clicking buttons (e.g. select the desired actual, select time-frame to forecast, etc.) or via voice command.

??

Further, I want to simulate the impact of a potential management decision (e.g. decreasing retail price by 2%) or the influence of external developments (e.g. increase in resource prices by 3%). The input to this can be entered via a small ?€?scenario?€? or ?€?decision?€?-menu: Select the desired item (e.g. retail price or resource price) and quantify the change in percent. Possibly multiple inputs can be entered at the same time, allowing to check different scenarios at once.

Ideally, this feature is connected to the Q&A Bots NLP-functionality on the one hand, and to the integrated assistant on the other hand. Thus enabling me as user to perform these simulations and forecasts via speech input, and then hand over assignments or schedule meetings via the assistant.

Cisco are not looking for PAi - they want to automatically deploy real time scores in HANA.  The only way today is PA exporting to UDF.  They would like this export in SAC, they are the first people to ask for it but they won't be the last and it is critical for them to consider SAC as an alternative to PA.  
My own thinking is that in the long term it would be better if this could be done as a one button operation which did not include the export.

Current Implementation: User has to find the builder panel (*hidden* in the ?€? menu) to change the table layout. A better way could be that the user can define whether a dimension should be shown on columns/rows next to the dimension name (e.g. a button).??

I, as a story viewer, want to have an ability to choose a different hierarchy for a dimension in the input control.

-----------------------------------------------------

As a end user, I would like to have the option to choose a different hierarchy in a input control based on the same dimension so that I don't have to use multiple input controls for each hierarchy. This would help me save time.

See below a use case from an internal OEM:??

??Ariba's??primary use-case is to display these in tables. Typically the objects like suppliers and buyers have multiple hierarchies ?€? one is typically their organizational hierarchy and another is that groups them based on geographical proximity (they might want to use maps here, but tables also work fine here).

They would want to expose these models to end users for explorations. Hence, multiple dimensions (one for each hierarchy) for the same object might really not be a good idea.

When searching for a member, the need to for an option to select ""Only search results""

+*Use cases:*+

??From FPA34-4424 *Siemens*

*Select ""ALL"" search results in member selector:*

*Scenario:*??

Business User??needs to filter on a great number of items that follow a similar pattern. E.g. he wants to select all the cities starting with ""San"" (such as ""San Francisco"", ""San Diego"" and ""Santa Barbara"", etc.) out of a big pool of cities.??

*Expectation:*??

In order to do so, he'd like to search for the string ""San*"" and select all matching dimension members (with the ability to turn iterations, i.e. select first all cities starting with ""San"" and then add all cities starting with ""New""). This should work for *variable prompts,*??*story filters*, *charts filters* and in *data exploration* mode.??

It already works for Input Controls, check??https://sapjira.wdf.sap.corp/browse/FPA34-353.

*Note:*

This should also work??vice-verca, i.e. the business users wants to select??*all cities except*??the??ones starting with ""San"". The most convenient approach would be

1) Select all

2) Search for??""Sac"" and deselect these cities.??

??

From *Exxon*:

ExxonMobil has noticed that its end users always will search for a member (i.e. Singapore) and assume that *All Results* acts as the same way as *All.* Hence, they run into situations where they have to delete their search, deselect All and then search for a member.

?€?

Original request:

Our customer has been complaining about the behavior of dimension input controls with multiple selection functionality. It is not intuitive when searching for an entry and selecting it, because the dimension input control treats this process as if the user is ""selecting to exclude"" the dimension member. In the background the ""ALL"" member is still selected and the searched dimension member is then excluded from the filter.

Expected behaviour is like in MS Excel when searching through a column. ""All"" is displayed by default, however when searching through the dropdown list of available dimension members and selecting one member for filtering, the ""All"" member should automatically be deselected.

Current behaviour and necessary steps to flter one member from the list during search: First, unselect ALL, and then ""search"" the member you would like to select.

The customer would like a behaviour like in MS Excel.",1,1

Reasons:

1) It creates potentially un-expected display of data to the end user (as described by customer Randstadt in attached Word doc): The variable screen is populated with the value saved with the story. When the user presses Cancel on the variable screen, the query is nevertheless run with the saved variable value and the result is displayed in the story!

Customer created BCP ticket??""35272 / 2019 Can??t save story without data"".

2) The Story creator isn't necessarily the one consuming the story so both might need to use different values.

3) Some variables (especially date/time) are populated with dynamic default values (e.g. BW exit variables), such as current period, key date). Usually it doesn't make sense to run a report with such saved values, but instead with the current date/period. Other values of other variables make sense to be saved which is why it makes sense to determine the subset of variables the values of which are to be saved with the story (with an easy way to select all or none).

??

We should consider to have these options to set for a Story:
 * [radio] Save with all variable selections
 * [radio]??Save without any variable selections
 * [radio]??Save without selections for exit / dynamic variables only
 * [checkbox]??Automatically open prompt when Story opens

This functionality will provide support for customers using standard BW functionality, which is supported fine by Business Objects, BICS etc. but not by SAC.

 * HANA 879 all time customers with 14480 connections, 860 connections in the last month, 6% rise
 * _BW 883 customers with 13,370 connections, 1002 in the last month, 7.5% rise_

_- below details of the customer requests ?€?_??

Feedback from Stijn Debever interview (January 2019):

Smart Features needs to be available on BW live connections.

The requirement is to have the Smart Features on Live connection to HANA / Live connection to BW/4 / Live universe connection. For BW main objects are Bex Queries or Composite InfoProviders. The reason is that for most customers the authorization concept is built on BW layer. Customers also leverage specific BW features like customer exits and specific calculation types. This is the case for a big name prospect (Stijn will look with AE if that prospect can be named).

In term of priorities (most priority to least priority)
 # Live connection on HANA
 # Live Connection on BW/4 (ideally to be delivered on the same year)
 # Live Universes can be done afterwards.

_Rob_: Do you have customers that would like to access to HANA?

_Stijn_: Yes ?€? the question is what the intermediate modeling layer should be.

Interview with Martina Schnelle (Presales Analytics, Feb 2019)

------------------------------------------------------
 * connecting to BW4 or BWonHANA since customers are asking for this (e.g. Boehringer in Feb 2019). don't bother with BW 7.4/7.5

??

----------------------------------------------------

Novartis (March 2019)

------------------------------------------------------
 * Novartis is transitioning from BW 7.4 to BW 7.5 then to BW/4HANA. Their BW/4 (also called EDW ?€? Entreprise Data Warehouse) will be based on HANA 1.0
 * They mentioned that manual loads / flat files is not scalable and that we should allow database/data warehouse access.??

----------------------------------------------------
 ??
 Andreas Forster (March 2019)
 ??
 ------------------------------------------------------
 ??* Many customers expect BW support directly w/o going to the HANA layer. They consider the access through generated HANA views a work-around since this forces them to look at a technology (HANA) for which they have no expertise. They just use HANA as a runtime/database, but all their experience is in BW. If they are forced to go through HANA, their operations need to be adapted: user provisioning, authorizations, testing of now two artefacts (BW & HANA) instead of one. Good example is Richemont who even had many SAP experts on site since in order to ensure that the complex security requirements that they successfully implemented on BW work 100% identically when accessing through Hana. Novartis has not exposed their BW objects as HANA views either due to the increased testing efforts that this would entail
 ??* If Smart Predict works on BW, then the results need to be written back as well. A key point will be on how to manage the quality of the prediction results in the context of BW. All other BW content is highly managed & polished for quality; now business users start creating new data in BW of unknown quality. What visibility should this data have Who should access it?
 ??* Since BW data is meant for reporting, not predictive, BW live data will need to be prepared somewhere for proper usage in a predictive context (time slice aggregations, joins of multiple sources etc.)
 ??
 BASF (May 2019)
 ------------------------
 Data preparation in Excel is hard; we really need live access to BW queries|

BHP (September 2019)
 -------------------------------
 They are on BW4, and will be upgrading to BW4 v2.0 by October. Ideally they would like to leverage BW queries (or equivalent calculation views) as a source for training the predictive models

H&M (October 2019)
 -----------------------
 o The Live connectivity to BW on HANA is a prerequisite to any Smart Predict usage ?€? due to the data volumes at play and the fact that data acquisition / replication into SAC is not really an option
 o Your data foundation for training predictive models are calculation views. You cannot use tables & SQL views in your BW on HANA system due to the nature of your license (HANA runtime). This would be a blocker to using Live Predict. This is a topic that is part of our 2020 roadmap. 
 o You are currently discussing with SAP and you should be able to license the APL component to deploy in your BW on HANA landscape.

I just did a design review for Barry Callebaut and they have issues in multiple places regarding missing fiscal year support for HANA live.

The base of the issue is, that SAC recognizes valid time hierarchies and automatically adds the desriptions to it. Therefore 201901 will always receive the tag Jan in SAC even though because of the fiscal year it could also be a different month.

This is especially problematic for widgets like the range filter and time series chart, where I cannot decide to only show the IDs but where the Description is automatically shown. For other, non-smart widgets it is not as big of an issue but it still exists as the description is then sometimes shown when hovering over the ID.

It would be good if we could implement support for fiscal years. The easiest solution would be to just be able to change to ID only for the time dimension. More elegant would be to enable a shift according to planning models, so the correct description is shown.

 o Customer needs a baseline to compare results ?€? HW-MAPE is complex to reverse-engineer/demonstrate and not really applicable in the current business case. 
 o HW-MAPE is not the good indicator to use when you have actuals with values = 0 (causes division by zero). We would like to get the customer to adopt simpler & more widespread indicators like MAE or RMSE. 
 o Marc will work on a Python prototype to transfer to CTAC / Greenery to produce Factory debriefing results with better fitted indicators (thanks so much Marc). Nico, examples of real-world models created by CTAC would help Marc. 
 o A key topic to consider is the adoption of these indicators by CTAC first and The Greenery secondly. 
 o It?€?s OK for Nico if Marc comes back with a prototype by 31/10. 
 o All customer feedback & evidence on how they can trust the forecasts is very valuable to product management. Nico to please collect these. 
 o In general series with 0 are not the best fit for using the PA technology; it would be important to keep in mind aggregations as a way to reduce zeros in series. We are not the best technology to predict one-time sales events.

 SAP Intelligent Data & Analytics would need to see the MAE/RMSE in Factory. This can be extended to Smart Predict. Smart Predict only displays HW-MAPE as of now.

 ?€? We agreed that the mean MAPE is not the best indicator to debrief a segmented model as the strange entities would twist the mean.

From FPA34-4414: Controls panel needs to be editable to give user a central place to manage filtering

*Milliken* has attempted to use the Dynamic Texts in a story with multiple tabs to be able to keep track on what is being filtered but finds option cumbersome. They are comparing functionality to Qlikview to be able to control filters centrally. See attached. Milliken is using BW Live

Overview
 It is difficult for an end user to know what all is being filtered on within a SAC story. 
 The QlikView tool gives you the ability to add an object that will dynamically keep up with the selections that you have filtered on within that page or the entire application called a Current Selections. It dynamically populates with the filters being applied as seen below. These filters could come from something like a tab filter or simply filtering on the data by clicking in a chart. If the data on the tab is filtered, it will show up in the Current Selections box. You can also see easily what tabs these filters are applied to (the green square to the right of each tab name). You also have the ability (with the blue buttons) to easily move forward thru your selections, move backwards thru your selections or completely clear your selections.??

Also for GPI, we had recommended the use of linked analysis for some of the performance issues they were having on their pages to limit amount of data that gets displayed. The reason they could not use it was it was too hard for them to keep track on what has been filtered overall on a story. The Dynamic texts could help them with input controls and story filters however linked analysis were not part of the options. Removing filters per visualization is very cumbersome and not intuitive. GPI is using acquired data from BW??

*Richemont International:*

Richemont is asking for a way??to have filter controls expended in page but leading all pages. Our explanation with the current design, top being for entire story, page for local page is not satisfying and sufficient as the current setting is not consistent as if you create a restricted measure with input control, the control stays in the page where it was initially created despite the fact that it interacts with all pages making use of the restricted measure. In addition with no possibility to move it to another page later on.

All filters should be in one place according to their feedback:

*Problem Statement:*

Today, I as a story designer when adding a single select story or page filter, there is an ?€?all?€? member?? automatically included. In many business scenarios the ?€?all?€? option does not make sense in single select filters. While the option to hide ?€?all?€? exists, it is not easy to discover, and moreover, story designer cannot hide ?€?All?€? option on the widget level filter.

*Expectation:*

I as a story designer want to have an easy to discover, intuitive way to disable the ?€?all?€? members option for single select filters for story, page and widget level filters.

----

original request:

When you add a dimension filter to a chart, you will be asked (1) what member values to make available in the dropdown and (2) if you want a multiple or single selection. If I picked Single Selection, the users will see all the Member values I selected to display as well as the ALL selection.

As a story designer, I don't want the users to be able to choose ALL selection because the combination of all member values??won't make sense to them. Currently, I don't see an option to hide this. I would like the same feature just like in the Dimension Input Control where I can show/hide the Select ALL option.

The opportunity this request will address is for the developers to have full control of the options to display to the users.??

The expected benefit will be for the users to avoid logical confusion on why there's an ALL option if it won't mean anything to them.",1,1

Sorting in a crosstab always means, that we sort e.g. the second dimensions AFTER the first dimension / column. In the example of the video, with break grouping disabled, we sort values of customer descending ""inside"" LATAM.
When Break grouping is activated, the crosstab behaves like a flat table, which means we are sorting the second column (customer) regardless of first column.

Many times for financial reporting a customer will want the order something like this:

Actual - ForecastQ2 - ForecastQ1 - Budget

They want that order as ForecastQ2 is more recent that ForecastQ1 which is also more recent than Budget.

With SAC currently the user would get this:

Actual - Budget - ForecastQ1 - ForecastQ2

Further if we enable variances within tables they may want the variances to follow compared to version before going on the next version. Many times just for the most recent.

+(Sarah Detzler feedback - Jan 2019)+

Customers want to deliver HW-MAPE values for all or certain segments so that this information can be consumed alongside the forecasts themselves (outside SP debrief)

Why? Associate quality indicator to the displayed forecasted value.

May concern: consumption of forecasts in SAC Planning, in BI Story, outside SAC.

See??[https://sapjira.wdf.sap.corp/browse/FPA34-3344]??for Novartis screenshot

+Customer: SAP - Operational Demand & Workforce Planning.+??

Spoke with Mohamed Judi who was working with internal SAP Finance teams on this use case. They are not working with SAP Enterprise Analytics.

The customer wants to forecast revenue for the different sales bags within SAP for each quarter. This forecast information in turn be used to influence workforce planning and headcount allocation. They are asking for time series forecast to be applied to 1329 segments (each segmented is Region_MarketUnit_SalesBag). The results are then shown in visualizations via SAC stories to the end consumer.

{*}The ask is that the end consumer should be able to understand the strength (whatever variable we use, if it is MAPE or ends up being something else) of the predictions for each segment{*}. The business value of this is that the end consumer needs to be aware of whether the prediction is trustworthy or not for production, but they also need to understand the segment's performance against other segments to understand prediction effectiveness. For example, it is hard to say that any segment with a MAPE > 10% is not reliable... it is relative to the other segments. For example, if all the segments have a MAPE around 10% it means that other segments with MAPE around 10% are performing similar to the rest of the model, and perhaps those with MAPE around 15% are not that bad in comparison.??

Mohamed also mentioned it is important to give context around when the model was trained and applied, so that the end consumer can understand if things are out of date which may affect the results.??

Lastly, Mohamed mentioned that the customer is more interested in seeing the MAPE for each segment (where all forecasts are created and information on MAPE is transparent) over filtering out/not creating forecasts for segments where HW-MAPE does not meet certain conditions (see??[https://sapjira.wdf.sap.corp/browse/FPA34-3343])

Novartis: Predictive Forecast in Planning:??*should show the MAPE to evaluate how good the forecast is =>*??see attached screenshots from Novartis

+American Hotels+ raised a similar issue about details of the forecast.

+At a partner workshop in June 2019+ - several questions were raised about understanding the forecast. In particular *the signal decomposition in Smart Predict gave them confidence.*

+Exxon+ said - it was not clear why 'confidence interval' is so high. They think forecast was useless.??It would be better to *be informed that* {*}Quality is poor and assist with additional information to explain WHY{*}.????

+Delivery Hero - October 2020+
?€? We agreed that the mean MAPE is not the best indicator to debrief a segmented model as the strange entities would twist the mean. A representation of the segments against the HW-MAPE would be preferred, especially if combined with a threshold to push the accurate forecasts. Right now the filtering would be ad-hoc & manual. 
?€? I would like to add one more point which we discussed that is there any possibility to bring the MAPE of an entity at the story.

+Delivery Hero (November 2020)+
I met our Delivery Hero customer at lunchtime. I had submitted the following question to him - how to best evaluate the quality of the predictions in the stories?

After an explanation of the text, I validated the following points:
 - Redirecting financial planners to Smart Predict's UI is possible, but only as a workaround - too much detail, too technical
 - HW-MAPE is not ideal as an indicator - impossible to recreate (reverse-engineer), difficult to understand.
 - Manoj prefers to have access to predictions for the past as well as for the future in order to be able to make variance calculations on past periods. Ex: if I predict Jan to Dec 2021, I can compare my predictions vs actuals for 2020 in a story as a proxy for the quality of my model and my predictions for 2021. This is the purpose of the user story [https://sapjira.wdf.sap.corp/browse/FPA00-27900]",2,1

Customers progress on the automation of forecasts based on their degree of maturity in the predictive process.

??The use of forecasts would be done the following way:
 * ??Typically customers would automate the top segments (MAPE less than 10%). This means that users would not need to look into them and that the forecasts would flow in the planning system as the de-facto truth.
 * When the MAPE is acceptable but not great, the controllers would decide if they use the predictions or not. They would need to be provided individual MAPE + error bars.
 * For the bottom segments where the MAPE is not acceptable, the predictions would need to be discarded and not provided to the controllers. In that case the controllers would need to decide on the planned forecasts.

??HW-MAPE can be easily understood by controllers. We can think of simpler indicators like color coding but it?€?s not really mandatory, more of a nice to have.

Requirement: Customers want to filter out the creation of certain forecasts based on a HW-MAPE threshold ?€? they want to discard the segments that cannot be trusted because the HW-MAPE is more than X%.??

Customers would not like to create the forecasts if the HW-MAPE is too high. They do not want to expose the consumers of the forecasts to an information that cannot be trusted from the start.

The past experience with these two customers (Daimler & Fraport) is that the regression results (predicted values) were not accurate at all.?? [Antoine's note: These POCs were done in the context of PA on-premise not Smart Predict, however the automated regression algorithm is unchanged.]

This caused a lot of reluctance from the Analytics pre-sales team in Germany to position the regression scenario. The team would position in priority classification or segmented time series use case as it was not possible to compete and win using regression.??

The??only successful regression PoC??that was done was for Randstad - in that case the customer had no previous baseline to refer to.??

The??customer pain point is the non-accuracy of the predicted values.??This??FPA34 asks for improving the accuracy of the results and the predicted values. This will make it possible to address more use cases over the long run.??

Exxon Beta Feedback (October 2019)

This enhancement request has been flagged as Medium = not a showstopper. 

Greenery - September 2019
-------------------------------
The core data is in BW Bex Queries (coming from ECC). The use case is product demand forecasting - Greenery supplies vegetables & fruits to supermarkets. Basically if you sell bananas in August you get a data point in your BW Query and in the resulting dataset. But if you do not sel bananas in December, no data point and you'll need to complete the series with the data point Bananas, December, 0 sales. This is exactly the same concern as Exxon.

VMware (SAC customer - PoC pred in SAC):??
 * work with a predictive dataset of 350 columns (snapshot of their customer portfolio - target 1 = installation of a product / target 2 = adoption of the product)
 * they want to understand??install/no install and adoption/no adoption behaviors
 * they cannot leveraged this list of customers info in Smart Discovery (>100 columns) => COE suggested smart predict
 * it is mandatory for them to analyze pred outputs by different segments (region especially because of their customer support organization)
 * so, until the limitation to 100 columns in smart discovery will be over, the solution is smart predict + BI story => blocked by the number of columns if they select??""all var""
 * workaround: key column in the dataset + SAC blending - but they find SAC blending complicated
 * solution: when applying the pred model, giving them the possibility to select some columns + predictive outputs
 * note: this is considered as a workaround because of 100 columns limitation in BI stories
 * Use case as expressed by Jason White (COE USA):""... why their customers have purchased but not installed a product or installed and not adopted a product.?? The executives don?€?t care about the model building but they do care about the insights which include the categories underneath the contributing variables that explain why a customer would buy but not install or adopt a product.??

They are responsible towards users of their figures (i.e. senior FIN mgmt & SAP CFO) in being able to explain the automatically generated figures. So understanding influencers is one side, but so is also understanding why certain influencers were not chosen (and this is what this FPA34 is about) .

In the concrete case of SAP Forecasting CoE's marketing cost model, their analyses looked e.g. at # of marketing leads as influencing factor to the target ""marketing costs"". They inspected several lags and identified that lag12 has reliably having a high correlation (corr = 0.52 -> relevant). But that variable was chosen by the model when they did their forecast in March 2018 (aka: forecast round #3). When they redid their forecast later in the year (aka forecast round #7), the lag12 variable was now included by the model.??

I agree we don?€?t state that they will give the same results. Most results describe Smart Discovery as ?€?Uncover key influencers of KPIs by using classification and regression?€?.

 Attending customers: [Daimler, W&W Informatik, EY, Lufthansa, Adidas, GMH, CSM, DEG, Hellmann, State of Baden-Wuerttemberg, VRN, German Army, Volkswagen]
 Feedback on Classification model debriefing: 
 a) in-place help everywhere - on hovering I should see help on all complex parts of the debriefing screen like to answer questions like
 - what does predictive power & confidence practically mean? Does KI = 66% mean that I am right 66% percent of the time?
 - what does the percentage of true positives (and FP/FN/TN) mean practically - how do I practically interpret this?
 - why is contacted population and predicted yes the same number? Can I chose by sliding when my prediction is yes? What type of a predictive tool is that then, where my sliding does the prediction?
 - all jargon needs explanation (specificity, sensitifity, F1-score, ..)
 - Performance curves needs ample explanation - through hover over, link or embedded video
 Note: StatsIQ does this very well; Jan Fetzer can share a video

b) Show absolute number also, not only percentages
 - I want to see absolute numbers, not only percentages, in order to better follow the computations done by the system (today, it's very hard to understand how big the training and validation set is and thus follow many of the computations that build on it (like confusion matrix)

c) confusion matrix:
 i)what does the default threshold signify and why is it chosen at that level? 
 ii)in order to better grasp the percentages, I'd like simulate what they mean in absolute numbers by setting a custom population size 
 iii) today, all percentages always refer to 100% for the entire matrix. To better understand e.g. how true positives and false positives relate, it would be good to be able to switch to having them sum up to 100% (telling me e.g. that 1/3 of my predictions = yes are actually true)

d) Profit curve
 - when I enter numbers for cost/profit and then navigate away to another tab of the debriefing, my entries are reset to zero
 Total profit: what calculation is behind it ? How does it relate to the slider values and my cost/profit per item?

Internal Hackathon WDF Oct 2019 
Participants heavily complained about the end-to-end workflow which essentially forces users to recreate most or all of the artefacts again from scratch, if they want or have to change something. Reasons are: 
a) [data in datasets cannot be refreshed|https://sapjira.wdf.sap.corp/browse/FPA34-4780]
b) thus settings for pred model need to be redone to match those of the new dataset
c) datasets are suggested to be wrapped in BI models, but there is no way of loading the data from an updated apply-out dataset into a BI model that has previously been created
d) by creating a new model to match the new data in a refreshed apply-out dataset, the story built on the original BI model needs to be rebuilt. 
Participants hated it and made clear that the end2end process only works for a one-off prediction, not for a prediction that needs to be repeated regularly.

 * hover-over help on data points (exact value in the context of the chart)??

 * Curated list of short helper videos (3-10 mins) that are relevant in the context of the current app (StatsIQ is only a sub-app within Qualtrics)

Feedback from Stijn Debever interview (January 2019):

Smart Features needs to be available on BW live connections.

The requirement is to have the Smart Features on Live connection to HANA / Live connection to BW/4 / Live universe connection. For BW main objects are Bex Queries or Composite InfoProviders. The reason is that for most customers the authorization concept is built on BW layer. Customers also leverage specific BW features like customer exits and specific calculation types. This is the case for a big name prospect (Stijn will look with AE if that prospect can be named).

In term of priorities (most priority to least priority)
 # Live connection on HANA
 # Live Connection on BW/4 (ideally to be delivered on the same year)
 # Live Universes can be done afterwards.

_Rob_: Do you have customers that would like to access to HANA?

_Stijn_: Yes ?€? the question is what the intermediate modeling layer should be.

----------------------------------------------------

Interview with Martina Schnelle (Presales Analytics, Feb 2019)

------------------------------------------------------
 * connecting to BW4 or BWonHANA since customers are asking for this (e.g. Boehringer in Feb 2019). don't bother with BW 7.4/7.5

??

----------------------------------------------------

Novartis (March 2019)

------------------------------------------------------
 * Novartis is transitioning from BW 7.4 to BW 7.5 then to BW/4HANA. Their BW/4 (also called EDW ?€? Entreprise Data Warehouse) will be based on HANA 1.0
 * They mentioned that manual loads / flat files is not scalable and that we should allow database/data warehouse access.??

----------------------------------------------------
 ??
 Andreas Forster (March 2019)
 ??
 ------------------------------------------------------
 ??* Many customers expect BW support directly w/o going to the HANA layer. They consider the access through generated HANA views a work-around since this forces them to look at a technology (HANA) for which they have no expertise. They just use HANA as a runtime/database, but all their experience is in BW. If they are forced to go through HANA, their operations need to be adapted: user provisioning, authorizations, testing of now two artefacts (BW & HANA) instead of one. Good example is Richemont who even had many SAP experts on site since in order to ensure that the complex security requirements that they successfully implemented on BW work 100% identically when accessing through Hana. Novartis has not exposed their BW objects as HANA views either due to the increased testing efforts that this would entail
 ??* If Smart Predict works on BW, then the results need to be written back as well. A key point will be on how to manage the quality of the prediction results in the context of BW. All other BW content is highly managed & polished for quality; now business users start creating new data in BW of unknown quality. What visibility should this data have Who should access it?
 ??* Since BW data is meant for reporting, not predictive, BW live data will need to be prepared somewhere for proper usage in a predictive context (time slice aggregations, joins of multiple sources etc.)

 BASF (May 2019)
 ------------------------
 Data preparation in Excel is hard; we really need live access to BW queries|

BHP (September 2019)
 -------------------------------
 They are on BW4, and will be upgrading to BW4 v2.0 by October. Ideally they would like to leverage BW queries (or equivalent calculation views) as a source for training the predictive models

H&M (October 2019)
 -----------------------
 o The Live connectivity to BW on HANA is a prerequisite to any Smart Predict usage ?€? due to the data volumes at play and the fact that data acquisition / replication into SAC is not really an option
 o Your data foundation for training predictive models are calculation views. You cannot use tables & SQL views in your BW on HANA system due to the nature of your license (HANA runtime). This would be a blocker to using Live Predict. This is a topic that is part of our 2020 roadmap. 
 o You are currently discussing with SAP and you should be able to license the APL component to deploy in your BW on HANA landscape.

ThyssenKrupp (September 2019)
 -----------------------------------
 2019-09-26: Customer has been playing on 3month trial tenant until June, esp. in through a master thesis and has now stopped usage. Main blocker would be live access to BW data, esp. since they have only HANA runtime license.

Novartis (November 2019)
----------------------------
Novartis is not relying on SAP HANA today. Thus they won?€?t be able to use Live Predict in the short term. Novartis is using BW and BPC and plans to move to BW4. 
Antoine mentioned that  Live Predict will be extended as part of the 2020 roadmap to calculation views on BW deployments based on HANA.
At the moment Novartis policy doesn?€?t allow to use calculation views in the ?€?HANA part?€? of BW. One of the reasons is because the security concept is defined in the ?€?BW part?€?.

AUDI (2019) => HANA SCP (sensors data)

Heartland Dental (July 16):

They standardize their backend / datawarehouse strategy on HANA 1.0 on SAP Cloud Platform. They expect not to acquire data in SAC, they want live connectivity to this environment.
 In the context of the Live Predict beta, we only support HANA on-premise systems so the beta is unfortunately not an option for them and I made this clear. We will take note of the requirement for HANA 1.0 on SAP Cloud Platform support.

Greenery =>??HaaS

Base architecture for PoC was (2019):
 ?€? Original data in ECC on Oracle
 ?€? Extraction of relevant data into BW on Oracle. After substantial data cleansing, prediction-relevant data is exposed to as BW Queries
 ?€? Replication of BW query data into *Hana as a Service* (The Greenery has no SAP HANA onprem license). Exposing of data as Calc Views
 ?€? Predictive modelling in Predictive Analytics (PA) and Predictive Factory (PF). Predictive results stored in HaaS
 ?€? SAC live connection to HaaS. Goal to do planning / adjustments based of those predictions, comment, collaborate & approve there. They'd eventually export the final plan numbers to ECC via SAC export (csv) and ECC import. Respective planning functionality is available at this point in SAC.

Mohawk Carpet, LLC (October 2019)
 ----------------------------------------
 Mohawk owns SCP and SAC and has a Employee Retention initiative that they are working on right now. Our recommendation was to land the data from SFSF in to SCP and then predict employee churn. This could be a huge hang up.

Antoine's POV
 ----------------
 It would ideal if we can get visibility on what would be the possibilities & cost of being able to consume HANA cloud data as a source for Live Predict. We see more & more customers looking after these upcoming flexible data integration options. Side-note: it was decided on October 21 not to create a dedicated FPA34 for DWC integration, due to lack of customers asking (to date).

Milcobel (October 2019) - SAP contact: Stijn Debever
 ----------------------------------------------------------
 I have a question for a customer, it could be that this was already mentioned in the last calls around live predict, but I have received so many information lately?€?
 The has Hana as a service on cloud foundry enterprise edition. They would like to use apl for predictions, but this is not available on this system. They are also looking in all possible usescases they could have for using SAP Analytics Cloud.
 Since they have rights in this system to create hana sql views, I was wondering if they could use Live Predict from sap analytics cloud to generate predictions?

Jan's POV (Nov 2019)

------------------------------

Cloud HANAs each have their own complexity & roadmap, so we need to keep our powder dry & spend wisely:??
 * HANA as a Service on Neo is non-strategic
 * HANA as a Service on CF will be replaced by HANA Cloud, but until HANA Cloud matures is possibly the best cloud HANA that we have. Its support by SAC is really bad though: the [guided setup playlist|https://www.sapanalytics.cloud/guided_playlists/sap-hana-hdi-in-sap-cloud-platform-cloud-foundry-live/] specifies a full 10h (!!!) of config time. The guide itself is partially outdated (linking to deprecated sources) and jumps wildly to other blogs, youtube videos from HANA academy, lenghty other documents etc. Core issue is that HANA CF has no INA endpoint and thus an INA endpoint needs to be made available through the [HANA Analytics Adapter|https://github.wdf.sap.corp/AnalyticsBackendTeam/HanaAnalyticsAdapter/wiki]??that is technically an own CF service. On top, HDI containers are required on HANA side to wrap the exposing calc view, but this will go with wave 23. It took Endress+Hauser 3 full days in Oct 2019 with plenty of SAP support and not get it working for a SAC BI scenario. This is certainly nothing that is widely adopted by SAC BI currently and thus we should keep our hands off it for the time being
 * HANA Cloud: this is obviously the new kid on the block and definitely strategic, but the Hana Analytics Adapter mess will stay around for quite some time (verified w HANA PM Dominique Noth). So our best bet is to prepare ourselves (thus readying APL for HANA Cloud, cp epic FPA00-21842), but push the end2end integration further down our roadmap at this point.??

 * Clustering is an intuitive way of grouping things (e.g. customers, products). In contrast to Classification & regression, is a fairly easy to grasp concept for lay people w/o a data science mindset
 * The result of clustering should be reusable for subsequent steps like??
 ** basis for TSF segmentation
 ** draw a lasso around individual or many clusters (=filter) and use those objects in other charts
 ** Regarding the lasso:

 # 
 ## 
 ### Use the cluster number as new dimension. Then it can be easily used in charts for visualization and filtering.
 ### You would expect that after a clustering the cluster members reside closely together in a visualization like a cluster plot. Provide a lasso as filter for selecting individual points that ly closely together. You might get points from more than one cluster with this.

------------------------

Martina Schnelle Interview (Analytics Presales, Feb 2019)??

---------------------------------

Some numeric data is not well suited for visualization. Some customers ask for this, because they want to report on age groups or salary groups rather than on age and salary, but have no grouping criteria in their database.These groups might possibly be generated from a predictive model.

Live Predict cannot be used productively due to the current security concept. 
The Security concept needs absolutely to be enhanced. In the current situation, it will not be allowed to use Live Predict for a productive solution

Quote: ""We have aligned with Simone on the list of users who are currently theoretically able to access our input datasets. The list of 34 users is too large, so we would not be able to test the next forecast exercise in SmartPredict. We are sorry for this. In case this security issue is fixed, we would be happy to start using Smart Predict on our live data.""

Requirements:
Short term ?€? restrict access to input and output datasets as well as Predictive Scenarios on session user
We would require the same security setup as Predictive Factory where a new user requests access to a specific project created in our Predictive Factory instance to determine which Predictive Scenarios the user has access to:

However, we also need to ensure that only these users have access to the live input datasets used for the scenarios in each project as the input data is sensitive.

Long term ?€? also restrict access to subsets of input dataset depending on session user
Once calculation views are supported as input to live Predictive scenarios, then we would like to leverage our ?€?GCON?€? authorizations which mean that a filter is set in the input calculation view based on the session user?€?s authorizations in the BW backend. This allows us to hide/expose data at a more granular level ?€? on profit center node for example.

Current workaround: add a page filter and limit it to only apply to the chart or table. When in explorer, open the designer panel - user can modify the filter value there. note, this still does not enable the viewer to add a measure based filter in explorer.

*Current Limitation:* Measure based filters are available via story and page filter, which don't satisfy the needs of the business user due to the following constraints:??
 * Story Filter:
 ** Applies to all widgets
 ** Dimension context needs to be configured in the very same way the table is configured - which is not intuitive, a lot of work for huge tables and error-prone
 ** Cannot be created ad-hoc in Explorer
 * Page filter??
 ** Needs to be configured by story designer
 ** Not available in Explorer.????

?€? Original Request

In a table or chart, the customer would like to only see those characteristics which have values for a calculated/restricted key figure. Right now, all characteristics are shown despite if they have values or not. 
 There should be a Key Figure Value Filter, so the user can decide whether to hide or show specific values. 
 Two scenarios for example would be:
 Show me all rows in a table for which key figure X is greater than 1000EUR.
 or
 Show me all rows in a table for which key figure X is <> NULL.",1,1

Analytics Designer Input:
 The wish from customer here is to reuse the BEx exceptions(exception level 1 to 9).

They would like to :
 * If the BW query with exception is defined as the data source, they wish to see the exception as default display.
 * If they wish to change or disable the BEx exception, they would like to have the option in SAC to disable or modify that.

??involved teams: BW live connectivity, table and (does it work for charts at all?) chart teams, app design

Note: modify the exception coming from Bex might not be possible at all from SAC. disable would be possible

??

Additional Requirement from VW:

The requirement here is not only to support the defined exceptions, but also to provide the flexibility to the report
designer to choose which column will be color coded when the exception is met. The screenshot below gives
an example for this use case. Here the exception is defined based on measure ?€?Indik.?€?, but the column D
gets the according color coding assigned.

There are multiple aspects to this requirement. This item is specifically focussed on the use cases around:-

1) Complete/partial?? landscape backup and restore either to cloud or on-premise.

?? ?? The ability to select content and take a 'backup' of the content at a point in time. This could be something that would be scheduled to occur a could then be restored at a point in time (to be determined how often and how long a backup could be taken/restored. This is similar to the export/import capabilities today and could use same mechanism with basic scheduling and published guidelines on usage.

2) System configuration backup and restore??either to cloud or on-premise.

??System setting including roles/users, audit and activity logs, usage data, schedules, import/export jobs, and potentially all other system wide elements.

Backups should be incremental and ??allow an administrator to restore.
Ideally backup would be to the 'cloud' (with option to backup on-premise) and would consume the customers tenant storage allocation (if such a thing were to exist).
With no current tenant storage limits a limit on the number of backups or restore points would have to be made.

Both the above to be available via API.

Items considered out of scope for this item would be:

*Current situation/As-is*

Currently the script function setVariableValue only sets the value for a single variable(you could find this example in Attachments named ""current situation""). For a data model with multiple input ready variables/input parameters, the script function setVariableValue needs to be called several times inside a script event.

Each script function call setVariableValue() generates a ?€?GetResponse?€? request during the application runtime, which implies a database roundtrip. In the worst case, the request will be generated N times with N equal the sum of input ready variables/input parameters per data model.

In the below example(in Attachments, named ""second""), we address two input parameters of a data model ?€?IP_CREATION_DATE_FROM?€? and ?€?IP_CREATION_DATE_TO?€? in a button onClick event script.

During the application runtime, we click on the button to execute the script with 2 setVariableValue() calls. In the network activities protocol (developer tools), we observe that 2 ?€?GetResponse?€? requests are generated.

??

The first ?€?GetResponse?€? request retrieves data with the variable values

?? ?? ?? -?? IP_CREATION_DATE_FROM: 20170101 --> as specified in the setVariableValue function

?? ?? ?? -?? IP_CREATION_DATE_TO: 20181031 --> initial/default value of the input parameter

While the second ?€?GetResponse?€? request retrieves data with the variable values

?? ?? ?? ??-?? IP_CREATION_DATE_FROM: 20170101 --> as specified in the first setVariableValue function

?? ?? ?? ??-?? IP_CREATION_DATE_TO: 20171231 --> as specified in the second setVariableValue function

?? ?? ????

Looking at the result set(see Attachments, named ""third""), the first ?€?GetResponse?€? is redundant and causes unnecessary loading time.

??

*Desired situation/To-be*

Similar to the setDimensionFilter function, where data requests for filtering the same data model are bundled into a single request, it is desired to have the setVariableValue requests for the same data model to be bundled into a single ?€?GetResponse?€? request to reduce additional loading time.

Smart Insights on live HANA,FPA34-3234,5564572,Epic,In Progress,FPA34,Medium,I051547,I311255,I311255,12/12/2018 13:18,4/14/2022 20:24,9/29/2022 9:56,,,,Smart Assist,,,,,,,"Support Smart Insights on Live HANA connection. This provides an option for BW customers in advance of??FPA34-3179.

??

We have to elaborate type of objects in HANA that should?? be supported for this request. For instance, Samsung is requesting for BW/4HANA connectivity which technically should come with this connectivity if we support tables/views/calc views..

??

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Feedback from Stijn Debever interview (January 2019):

The requirement is to have the Smart Features on Live connection to HANA / Live connection to BW/4 / Live universe connection. For BW main objects are Bex Queries or Composite InfoProviders. The reason is that for most customers the authorization concept is built on BW layer. Customers also leverage specific BW features like customer exits and specific calculation types. This is the case for a big name prospect (Stijn will look with AE if that prospect can be named).

In term of priorities (most priority to least priority)
 # Live connection on HANA
 # Live Connection on BW/4 (ideally to be delivered on the same year)
 # Live Universes can be done afterwards.

??

----
SAP EA expressed the fact that all security is defined in HANA and that it's not possible at all for them to re implement all this security in SAC, for instance assuming that they would download the data from SAP HANA into SAC. They want to REUSE their existing security defined in HANA on-prem right now.
 Not yet fully usable as live-connectivity (e.g. HANA) is missing.
 Also beneficial features are missing. (e.g. Consume HANA views)

They are process of building content using the application designer.?? They have proposed some enhancements around the use of OData connector to significantly improve the user experience and make their applications much more dynamic.?? I have bundled them together as addressing these items in individually versus holistically could lead to a unusable design.

*Connector*
 # More control on read/write from application designer (as opposed to full/incremental import/export defined in the Data Model)
 # Ability to hit non-sap OData sources from Application Designer or ability to make native calls against trusted RESTful service

*Parameters*
 # Ability to add parameters to OData queries
 # Ability to add parameters to embedded iFrames
 # Ability to use Master Data attributes (eg: Cost Center Owner, Entity Currency, Account Type, etc.)

I heard similar feedback from Column5, another implementation partner.?? However, these requirements seem to be much more structured.?? TruQua would be happy to discuss these items in more detail if there are additional requirements.

If we add additional properties in the model for dimensions and when these properties are added in the table , data points comments are not available for use. We get a message, Commenting service is currently unavailable.

??

This use-case is highly important for PLanning users across as semantics of dimensions plays a major role?? with properties combined and nonavailability of data points?? availability is a major set back users

To elaborate more on the use case,
1. In a Model, On any given dimension, ID and description a single way of defining its semantic but properties makes the dimension semantic extend to multiple modes and this is one of the good points in SAC that it provides additional ways to define the semantic of different unique dimension members you would like to classify.

2. These properties can be used as part of filters or as in columns in a table as SAC supports both for easy analysis. 

3.  As the image003.jpg screenshot describes the set use case for customers and probably more common for other customers as well, defining the same dimension member ID in different classifications makes the process of PLanning and Analysis more effective for customers. 
4. Refer image005.png which shows these properties can be used as filters and we see, the data point comments on a dimension member is disabled and this is as well an important use case needs to be addressed.

Currently the??LINK function can only read from a Planning model and not an analytical (Live) model.

For a Consumer Product Goods (CPG) organization the level of granularity for data is already extremely large, e.g. Exploded BOM for all our Finished Goods.

Typical calculations that require % of total may include:
 * % of Sales
 * % of Total Expenses
 * % of Operating Expense
 * % of Total Volumes
 * Cost Per Unit

??

More often then not, it is prefer that these calculations are evaluated at the report level rather than at the model level, and that's because: 1) they typically are not widely used across reports (i.e. they individual metrics do not have to be recreated across many reports), 2) they are pure ratio calculations and thus can be evaluated at any level within the multi-dimensional report (i.e. they do not need to calculate and aggregate),?? and 3) they typically do not need to be used in subsequent calculations.

??

Currently in SAC we have 2 paradigms for report calculations in our Table (i.e. in-grid calculations and cross calculations), but neither of these approaches easily allow us to address this typical reporting requirement.

This way the display would be flexible and managed centrally by one user that configures all input forms before each Forecast start.""

To fulfill quickly their requirements, I suggest to enhance the current UI existing UX of ""specific date"" and be able to select in this field an attribute of the model (instead of updating the date every quarter) this would allow the centralized maintenance and dynamic display of the input stories 
Examples provided :
Every quarter at BHP the Rolling Forecast Scenario rolls out an input story with 6 months looking back and 18 looking ahead

Dear Dev,

This is the request from all Planning customers and partners who are working with the SAC - BPC integration piece. After we create the Model in SAC using the BPC Data source, their is no way to go back and change the model to add the new dimension or remove the existing dimension or change the filters in the existing dimension like Stepan wants to change the time filter from 2016 to 2017, 2017 to 2018 , 2018 t0 2019 .... each year. Because of this limitation right now they have to create Model each year and then have to recreate the stories as well.

Would be nice to modify the model after its created in SAC using BPC connection.

Thanks and regards,
 Sushma

*Problem Statement:*

Today, a story designer needs to define the styling of each story individually. Existing story templates can be applied to a new or existing story, but what is being captured with templates is limited and inconsistent across story widgets. Moreover, these templates are not managed centrally and there is no way for a tenant administrator or a super-user to enforce consistent story design across the tenant and ensure compliance with corporate styling guide.??

*Proposed Solution:*

A tenant administrator or a super-user can create a centrally managed theme/template. A centrally-managed property of this artifact means that, once created, it can be applied to new and existing stories; if the original centrally-managed theme/template changes (e.g. updated logo, new preferred colour template) that change propagates to all stories to which this theme/template was applied.??

A centrally managed theme/template needs to be comprehensive and include:
 * preferred colour palette for widgets??
 * background colours/images
 * layout - story pages, lanes, widgets, text boxes, etc??
 * populated widgets, for example an image widgets with an?? image already defined??
 * default settings formatting, including number of d.p., scale, etc??

A creator of the theme/template may want to determine whether story designers can override the applied theme. A creator of the theme/template may want to see the related objects ( list of stories using the said theme)

A theme/template in this user story only applies to the contents of the story, it does not impact the SAC shell, such as toolbar or navigation pane.??

As a SAC Admin I would like to be able to define global themes in my tenant:????
 * Sales revenue is displayed in green and operating cost in orange,
 * Data coming from Germany displays in bold letters,
 * Actuals and Budget versions have a different format as well IT would like to define this rules so all business users will see the data in the same way.??
 * Define a custom unified for all users with the possibility to use corporate colors etc.??",1,1

Another example where the flow does not work for a very standard modelling process. Part of building a basic usable Smart Discovery that runs on BI data.

??

Use-case from Pilkington Group was that they added temperature and weather variations on their sales data. SD was showing total temperature by sales on 1st page in scatter plot that didnt make any sense. So he thinks if there was a calculated measure possibility he could perform an average or special formula for sales on weather data and then analyse the impact on average sales.

Scared of what is doing.??

Various SAP preslaes have indicated that if our customers know a little bit more on how it works or how it will be useful then it may increase the adoption of this feature more. Currently even pre-sales have hard time explaining for example how are top contributors derived.

??

Few customers have mentioned following reasons of not using Smart Insights:

Unilever: I don't know how Smart Insights finds top contributors , is it based on algorithm, does it look into entire dataset and how it is done ???I don't want my business professionals to blindly trust on something that may impact our business decisions .

Pilkington Group:?? I tried using it , was not sure what it was trying to tell. How it was coming to something on the top.??

??

Pfizer: Is Smart Insights available out of the box or separate extension is needed for this to work on the dataset/model ?

??

Exxon/AIG :??Let users know when a dimension is not considered and why. Explain why no smart Insights could be generated.??

??

In summary whenever we asked users the reasons of what is stopping them to use Smart Insights, it either comes to a point that 'It is not transparent and trust worthy OR the insights are too obvious. ' We have a separate Jira item to take care of 'Too OBVIOUS' requirement but here we want to focus on some indication that allow users to understand more about SI logic. Pointing a link to help or blog may not be sufficient alone.??

Suggestion is to provide in-line hovering or description .?? Attached couple of example on competitions are doing it.??

In the beginning something like - Smart Insights runs a statistical algorithm on dataset to find high variance to a selected datapoint or chart. And then it arranges the list in order of highest to lowest variance.??

If SMart Insights can't be generated - The most likely reason is , all dimensions are used in the story or chart already or for the context of user (filters) , the computation could not found any dimensions with high variance.??",1,1

User interaction is confusing. There should be separate filter for scope filtering and not using Page Filter for it. This cause a huge misunderstanding that the Smart Discovery is flexible enough to adapt the result to the filter after the discovery is ran, in fact it is not.
a. Example: 
i. For Dimension X, I select A,B,C for the scope in page filter and run the discovery
ii. Then I see Dimension X as a page filter, I deselect A, thinking that the result would change to reflect discovery on B & C only, in fact it is not. The discovery is done for A, B, and C and it wont be changed unless you run another discovery.
Proposed solution: Separate the page filter and scope filter.

As a story designer, I want to add a comments column to a table that displays the amounts for different accounts (in rows) in different time periods/versions (in columns). Some of the account measures are calculated measures (eg. gross cost after consolidation which is the difference of gross cost and the consolidation effect). As a story viewer, I want to comment on the displayed values using the comments column. At present, I cannot add columns for the lines belonging to calculated account measures.

Corresponding BCP incident entered by customer on March 13, 2019:
149020 / 2019 No data-cell based comments possible for calculated measures:

 We are working on Treasury dashboard content (RTC 1911 and RTC 2005).

There is one request that we need a input control to select multiple company codes for 2 charts.
 However the 2 charts consumes 2 different CDS query, technically we cannot build one input control for these 2 charts, however from business perspective, it does not make sense to have 2 companycode input control.

Is there a solution for our request?We think this is a very helpful and important feature , in replicate data model, we have shared dimension, however in live connection , there are no similar concept .
 Could you kindly check and help? Thank you

*Added Dec 24th:*
 Steps to reproduce:
 Since the old system environment is outdated, I uploaded another link for reproduce, also attached the screenshot :sample 2.

We need a company code filter that could control data from 2 different queries. In transaction data of query 1, there is only one company code value ""0001"", in query 2 , there are transaction data of company code s for ""001""-""005"". After the linkd dimension setting as suggested, the filter shows only ""0001"" ,which is a ""Join"" instead of expected ""Union"".

To solve this issue, do you think either of below is possible in future feature?
 1) Allow the ""company code"" filter to consume ""master data"" as well instead of consuming transaction value only

2) Enhance a kind of Union feature apart from current ""Join""( Link Dimension/Link Model)

3)?? (Added on April 1st, 2020):?? Besides the option to Union the LoV from all CDS data sources, app should be able to decide which CDS Data sources can union to make up the LoV for Filter & input control",1,1

 * Stories
 * Applications
 * Roambi (if it comes out of Beta)
 * Ad-hoc Analysis (if that comes)

This causes a number of challenges:
 * Users need to understand the pros and cons of each and need to make a decision before they start using it. We know from our past this is very problematic (Lumira v Design Studio v Webi v OLAP v Crystal v Xcelisus?? etc. We developed a 'tools zoo') and leads to much user confusion and frustration.
 * There will always and forever be challenges with moving from one to another. This leads to confusion and a huge cost of ownership. Customers will have built a story only then decide they want some feature only available in another artefact type. SAP will always have to explain when to use what when.
 * User experience across the artefacts will be different and in particular the User Interface will be inconsistent (or take huge efforts to ensure consistency).
 * Development effort needs to be duplicated over and over (for example, the API's to open content need to be duplicated for each artefact type. This also means external applications become more complex as they need to use different calls depending upon what artefact they want to use)

Proposed solution:
 * One simple cloud.
 * One simple artefact.
 * That artefact (if you like is an 'Application Building' app) and is the 'base' artefact.
 * Story building capabilities (that exist today) continue, but unlike today, they actually create the artefact with the 'script' hidden.
 * If scripting or additional non-story requirements are needed, then the artefact is 'enabled' for scripting and the scripting capabilities (that is Application Building today) become available and the 'story' can then be enhanced as needed.
 * The 'ad-hoc analysis' is just another widget in the existing library (or better still, is a combined functionality of the existing 'table' widget, so there is only one table widget, not multiple)

This would mean:
 * One simple cloud.
 * No integration issue between the various artefacts.
 * No user confusion about what artefact to use when (or worry about what future requirements might be and the cost of having to completely re-work that into another artefact type later, with potentially gaps in functionality)
 * Improved and consistent user interface
 * Reduced development efforts and improved time to market (no need for multiple APIs, Import/Export, File Types etc for each artefact type). Higher re-use. For example 'data sets' (roadmap item) could then be used in Stories as well as the Applications (improved performance too) No need for Digital Boardroom or Mobile to re-work for each artefact type. No need to develop means to copy content from one artefact to another etc. etc.",6,1

As an application designer, who wants to develop personalized applications I need the information which page/application is viewed by each user, how long users stay on each page/Application and which interaction they perform on the page/Application like filtering, accessing search to insight etc. This should be considered as a *?€?must have?€?.*

It is key to have access to the raw data (as HANA table) of the user behavior in terms of interactions with the solution. At the end, it has to be possible to tailor the report automatically to the user who opens it.

*For example:*

_If user ?€?A?€? always filters on country ?€?DE?€? and currency ?€?EUR?€? the report will open in that filter state automatically the next time user ?€?A?€? opens the report. This is achieved by linking the user ID (?€?A"") with the user IDs from the HANA usage tracking table. Thus, the filters applied by the user have to be stored in the HANA table._

*To clarify:*

In order to deliver a really automated personalized report behavior we need as much user interaction data as possible. It is obvious that the possibilities to extract the data for SAP development depend on the back-end architecture.

*+How to repro+*:

1. Ask Yadav, Vikas Kumar for login/password to SAC tenant [https://mobiinsight.us2.sapanalytics.cloud/sap/fpa/ui/tenants/024/app.html]

2. Launch the following URL:

[https://mobiinsight.us2.sapanalytics.cloud/sap/fpa/ui/tenants/024/bo/story/484322E86FEE750A84DE52DDF388E490?f01Model=t.F:VTEST_Richemont_1&f01Dim=0BWVC_0CALMONTH_SO&f01Val=[""200401"",""200402""]&f01Op=in|https://mobiinsight.us2.sapanalytics.cloud/sap/fpa/ui/tenants/024/bo/story/484322E86FEE750A84DE52DDF388E490?f01Model=t.F:VTEST_Richemont_1&f01Dim=0BWVC_0CALMONTH_SO&f01Val=%5b%22200401%22,%22200402%22%5d&f01Op=in]

This leverages the SAC URL API to open the story V_TEST_Bosch_Prompt_filter and create a filter on variable 0BWVC_0CALMONTH_SO (Calendar Year/Month (Selectoption)), with filter values 200401 (January 2004) and 200402 (February 2004).

3. Log onto BW system W4GBW via anzeiger/display as requested.

4. The story V_TEST_Bosch_Prompt_filter is displayed with the filter applied.

+*However, several problems occur:*+

*Problem 1: Warning Message*

A warning message pops up:

*Problem 2: Filter breadcrumb not created*

Even though the visualization is filtered as expected (displaying a value of 326 for 0BC_COUNT on Fiscal Year Variant Cal. Year, 4 Special Periods), the corresponding story filter breadcrumb on Calendar Year/Month (select option) is not created:

!image-2019-10-04-13-02-59-373.png!

??

*Problem 3: Filter breadcrumb values not updated*

When switching to Edit Mode, and forcing the creation of a filter breadcrumb on variable 0BWVC_0CALMONTH_SO (Calendar Year/Month (Selectoption)), the breadcrumb is created but the values January 2004 and February 2004 are not displayed in it:

!image-2019-10-04-13-03-39-142.png!

??

*Problem 4: Filter breadcrumb values not properly formatted*

When clicking on the breadcrumb, the following dialog box appears:

!image-2019-10-04-13-04-00-585.png!

It displays the values 200401 and 200402 instead of January 2004 and February 2004. Furthermore when clicking outside of this dialog box, the breadcrumb is refreshed with these values and again wrongly displays 200401 and 200402 instead of January 2004 and February 2004:

Issue 1) when 'inline legends' are used. The description isn't shown, when it should be.

??

Issue 1 - example: in one customer example there are 2 values, but the data label for the slice that has 11% isn't shown

Issue 2 - example: In one customer example there are just 2 values in the chart, but only the value with 82% is shown and the 18% value is not shown.

For both, there's no apparent good reason for this. It can't be because there's not enough space, there's lots of space. The customer perceives this as a bug, but I guess its 'by design'. It means the consumer has to work out the figure themselves or 'guess' what the data label is and this takes a lot of 'brain' time, it should be much more obvious. It should be so obvious you don't need to think at all, it should just speak for itself. This is the whole point of visualising data.

Please see attached PPT for screen shots

It would make sense to hide data labels or values when the number of slices in a pie is very high, but when the number of slices is small (this these example just 2 slices!) then it should never 'automatically' hide values or labels.",1,1

*USER FLOW DESCRIPTION*

In Stories or Analytic Applications there is a button that triggers an iFrame that lead either to the ?€?search to insight?€? or to the PwC Reporting 5.0 Q&A Bot. A prerequisite is that ?€?search to insight?€? is brought to the App Designer and it would be accessible via API so the question asked can be forwarded to the PwC Reporting 5.0 Q&A Bot.

*EXAMPLE IMPLEMENTATION BY PWC*

To implement this scenario PwC is using HANA Fuzzy search in the short term (recastAi in the long term). In order to give the user a fully intelligent solution??they want to combine Search to Insight and our own Q&A Engine.

How this could look in the App Designer from a process perspective (design would be done by us):

!Q&A_Bot_enhancement.png|thumbnail!

*What??PwC needs (must have):*

Search to Insight as an Element (like a chart) and an API to place the text for the query and ask for response.

Pseudocode:

_search_to_insight_1.setVisible();_
 _search_to_insight_1.setInput (?€?Show revenue for 2016?€?).run;_

*PwCs??first back-end Approach before implementing recastAi:*

Save questions in a table

Use fuzzy search to clean NLP noise

|2019.07.05|33|
|2019.07.06|32|
|??|??|

But the customer would like self-select or choose a customized current date. So we used feature customizing current date described here with video.?? However, when select different customizing current date, the date difference value does not change.

!image-2019-04-26-14-24-25-079.png!

After a call with HP on 19/06/19:
Here is the setup that HP has
 !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! 

Currently, the mapping is stored in an Excel file. The security to be applied would be dependent on whether users depends on specific categories of teams. Ideally, they would like a way to dynamically define the row level security based conditions on those properties. E.g.: Rather than defining the AWS_PS_PL team in SAC and then specifying which dimension members this team can view, they would rather add a condition on the user properties to define who can see which members. Much more scalable approach for the 1000+ users they are aiming to target.

We still wait for a final confirmation but we advised to inherited the DAC  (read and write columns of the dimension ?€?Cost Center?€? in the Planning model) of the 22 000  cost centers hosted in BW from BW.
 
As the configuration hasn?€?t been set in BW at BHP yet, maybe we could follow up on Siemens BW configuration unless it?€?s too specific. We might need bringing in a BW expert to find out what could be the cost of this lean complementary configuration.  
 
My answer to your other questions
 
Do they store today the mappings in another system? Which one? In which format? Yes in Excel
How many users? How many dimension members the security needs to be applied on? 1200 users and 22000 dimensions members
What is the workaround they would put in place today? There isn?€?t any workaround as workaround the partner asked for a new feature (a massive upload into the Model from Excel, copy/paste with 22 000 dimensions items being not really user friendly).  As this feature doesn?€?t seem to be in the JIRA pipeline (I checked but correct me if I?€?m wrong)  I was thinking that it would be better to use the DAC feature developed for Siemens , it is leaner and better from a maintenance perspective even if the customer needs to implement it.

Update:
This has been raised by Volkswagen. The usecase is very essential. They have dashboard requirements, which e.g. can be fulfilled 90% by Stories. At a certain stage in development of Story they see that this is not sufficient and have to rebuild everything in Analytics Designer. It is not just around the effort to rebuild, but also around the necessary skills needed.
If they would now have the ability to get those special requirements delivered by IT with Analytics Designer as composites and being able to reuse these ones inside Stories, that would be a huge value prop., also compared to our competitors.
Apart from the Volkswagen UseCase, with such a feature we would be able to overcome certain restrictions with stories by integrating those as appdesign widgets.

Second UseCase coming from ID&A:
Such a composite concept would enable ID&A colleagues to predefine Charts (what Measures, Dimensions, Filters) and deliver those predefined charts to the self-service users. They have a lot of charts wich are used in many stories and everytime sth. changes in the global definition of this chart, they have to maintain this in all stories.

In the report, a story filter on the dimension ""Profit Center Group for Consolidation"" allows the user to choose a profit center group within the profit center hierarchy. The consolidation will then be carried out with respect to this profit center group, by taking into account the consolidation effect booked to the choosen hierarchy node.

Within this context, the customer stumbled across the following design flaw of the filter component with respect to transactional data on non-leaf members. If the user selects all childs of a hierarchy node, the hierarchy node itself will automatically selected, too. However, if there is transactional data booked to this node, this feature is undesired.

Example:

Consider the following profit center hierarchy with consolidation effects booked to nodes:
|*Profit Center Group*|*Parent*|*Cons. Effect*|
|A|??|100|
|B|A|100|
|C|A|100|
|D|B|100|

Current behavior:
 # User selects A --> consolidation effect of 400 is returned. This is as expected.
 # User selects D, expects to get a consolidation effect of 100. --> B is autmatically selected, consolidation effect of 200 is returned.
 # User selects B, C, expeets a consolidation effect of 300 --> A is automatically selected, 400 is returned.
 # C is inactive because of a linked second filter, user selects B, expects consolidation effect of 200. --> A is not automatically selected, consolidation effect of 200 is returned.
 # User is only entitled to see C and its subnodes because of data access control, selects all, expects consolidation effect of 100 --> ??? (Not tested).

Desired behavior:

Parent nodes are not automatically selected if all of their childs are selected. It would be ok for the customer if this behavior is applied only after actively enabling a hierarchy for non-leaf-member booking.

The work-around of adding to each non-leaf node of the hierarchy an artificial child node as a leaf and to book the consolidation effect on this lead has been rejected by the customer because the additional leaves are thought to be confusing for the non-technically minded enduser and because creating and maintaining such a hierarchy would create additional overhead for data provisioning.",1,1

??

What is required to Deescalate?? Siemens here:

Respect the formatting as it was inputted in the data comments so that when a PDF copy is generated, the new line character is respected and it is as it was inputted.

??++??

+Architecture:+

Please find attached the architecture diagram.

??++??

+Gerneral:+

Audi is using an identity provider (IdP) from IBM called ?€?ISAM?€? to perform a SAML authentication against SCP. The IdP expects to get a valid client certificate to successfully authenticate the client.

Audi has implemented an own Framework (VWGIdentityFramework) which receives the client certificate from MDM and makes it available to the mobile client.

Audi wants to use the SAP Analytics Cloud SDK for iOS to implement the VWGIdentitiyFramework logic and to provide the SAC App with the respective client certificate.

Afterwards the SAC App should be able to successfully perform the client certificate authentication against their SAML IdP.

??

+Technical Details:+

The SAC mobile application will be used on managed iOS devices only. Audi has implemented the Audi ACSS App + the VWGIdentityFramework which acts like an authenticator. It handles the whole communication with the MDM and requires an initial multi-factor enrollment for security reasons (?€?strong authentication?€?). The VWGIdentityFramework is able to provide SAC with a client certificate (SecIdentityRef) via _Keychain Sharing_.??

Before the mobile client starts the authentication process it needs to have the SecIdentityRef available to reply the certificate challenge of the IdP.

??

By using the SAP Analytics Cloud SDK for iOS following prerequisites of the VWGIdentityFramework are already in place:
 * Adding VWGIdentityFramework as embedded binary
 * Enabling Keychain Sharing
 * Setting an own AppGroupIdentifier
 * Setting an own bundle id
 * Signing the application with an own Apple Enterprise Developer account

??

The following feature is currently missing:
 * There is no api/interface/protocol available to pass a SecIdentityRef (client certificate) during runtime for the authentication process.",2,1

*Customers want to see all available segments, including their Horizon-Wide MAPE.*

They are currently limited by the existing table component, which is too small (only displays 5 segments), cannot be maximized (made full screen), and cannot be sorted?? by decreasing/increasing MAPE.

There is a lack of consistency with the existing table component of SAP Analytics Cloud, that is available in a story, as this component can be maximized and sorted.

??

!5 Segments (current UI).jpg!

??BASF??voiced something similar in thei Exec Advisory Board project in procurement (supported by Jan Fetzer)

They are predicting prices for 95 raw materials and MAPE ranges from 0.25% to 706.5%. When you check below screen shot, it becomes immediately apparent, that they cannot get a meaningful overview on their 95 segments. Instead, only top10/bottom10 are shown and there is no meaningful way to filter, group, get an overview on what is going on general. Essentially,??*BASF wants to get an overview about the segments, their errors, their outliers and then zoom into specific ones for detailed analysis*. To that end, e.g. a histogram of MAPEs would help as would setting a MAPE threshold for filtering (e.g. show me only segments below/above 5% MAPE).Subsequently they would then like to analyse those filtered segments and possibly even do something with what they learned (e.g. exclude for model apply all inspected segments that??are above the threshold or somehow flag individual, inspected, bad ones for exclusion. )??

+Delivery Hero - October 2020+
?€?	We agreed that the mean MAPE is not the best indicator to debrief a segmented model as the strange entities would twist the mean. A representation of the segments against the HW-MAPE would be preferred, especially if combined with a threshold to push the accurate forecasts. Right now the filtering would be ad-hoc & manual. 
?€?	I would like to add one more point which we discussed that is there any possibility to bring the MAPE of an entity at the story.

End users would really appreciate the possiblity to have multiple tabs open at the same time in one BOC tenant and one browser screen (without workarounds such as ctrl+shift+n in chrome) . For example in BPC, I can have two screens with validations open and copy information from an existing validation to a new validation on the other tab.

This would make working with BOC so much easier, faster and user friendly. It would enable you for instance to copy masterdata from a model in one tab to a model in the other tab, or to have a model open in one tab while working in a story on the other tab. Currently users keep jumping between different screens, closing the story, opening the model etc.

[ Note from Terry Penner ] This multi-tab workflow is in other BI tools, particularly with frequent users.  Important consideration is that the license count is not incremented when the same user is logged in twice at the same time.  Recommend setting a fixed maximum of 10 concurrent open sessions per named user, following proven BI 4 standard.",1,1

API: Open Story URL API to distinguish between a Node or a Characteristic when the BW variable is based off a hierarchy,FPA34-4276,6223893,User Story,Open,FPA34,High,D052181,I049477,I049477,6/27/2019 12:01,7/13/2021 17:13,9/29/2022 9:56,,,,BW Integration,Developer/APIs,,,,,,"the Open Story URL API cannot distinguish between a Node or a Characteristic when the BW variable is based off a hierarchy.

This Enhancement Request is for the Open Story URL API to distinguish between a Node or a Characteristic when the BW variable is based off a hierarchy.

??

More background:

SAP Analytics Cloud Story is embedded within an ?€?iFrame?€? using the Open Story URL API. The hosting application is SalesForce.

The Story is based off BW and the URL provides BW Variable prompts values to filter the data at the data source

A BW variable filter is applied to a hierarchy.

The structure and contents of this hierarchy is key to this requirement. The hierarchy is a compounded characteristic.

The hierarchy stores:
 * ?€?customers?€?
 (implemented as a BW characteristic)
 * ?€?Customers?€? are grouped by ?€?accounts?€?
 (implemented as a BW Node).

Very confusingly and critical to this requirement an ?€?account?€? has the same ID and value as a ?€?customer?€? but not all customers within the same account!

In the SalesForce Portal the end-user needs to click on either an ?€?account?€? or a ?€?customer?€?.

If the end-user selects an ?€?account?€?, then all the customers, under that ?€?account?€? should be shown.

When using the Story API URL and the filter is intended to filter on the ?€?account?€? (node), then this customer would NOT be shown.

The requirement is for this customer to also be shown.

When the OpenStory URL API is used to filter to a ?€?customer?€? then all is fine and it works as expected.

However, when the OpenStory URL API is used to filter to an ?€?account?€? then there?€?s a problem. The problem is that only the customer with the same ID as the account is shown. Other customers, under the same account, are not shown. This is the problem.

If you like, the Open Story URL API cannot distinguish between a Node or a Characteristic when the BW variable is based off a hierarchy.

The problem is unique to the OpenStory URL API.

The problem does NOT occur when using the normal interface to filter.

Using the normal User Interface to select a BW node (account), then the filter is applied to the ?€?node?€? (account) and not to the characteristic (customer). The same functionality is required via the Open Story URL API.

Richemont actually prefers to not??load image URLs as an attribute to BW, but instead define a frontend rule to dynamically generate an image URL pointing to an external system where they store product images. They however accept the BW workaround if it comes quick.

For this customer case, we were asked to have Gauges Chart, the customers thought that APP Design is too complicated for them, they would like to have this kind of chat support out of box.

Also, during some workshops we delivered, some customers and partners also requested more chart types, especially when comparing with local BI solution vendors, our chart type is not rich enough.

Not sure if we have this type of chart support in the roadmap, if not, can we provide some code samples of some popular charts publicly(for App Design)? That will be much easier for customers to implement.

It means that if you have multiple Pie charts and Donut charts on a single page they typically will all be of a different size, even though each one is set to consume the same canvas size.

Things that impact the diameter appear to be:
 * show/hiding of titles/subtitles
 * the length of the title (and any dynamic text, which itself would be of variable length)
 * the number of slices in the pie (which would be dynamic)
 * the ratio of values between the slices (which would be highly dynamic)
 * probably many others like length/font of the labels and values

The impact is that the values are misleading, since the physical size of the slices are different by having a larger or small diameter. In the attached example you can see 3 donut charts set to consume the very same canvas size, but all 3 are different in size",2,1

A user who is setting up a data acquisition connection to Concur and defining data imports for all relevant T&E object types, needs to walk-through >100 manual steps to get the job done. All customers do the same again and again, so this is time-consuming and error-prone. SAP provides a word document with 10 pages to explain all object types, query fields, mappings, wrangling, import options, etc. . So, when SAP knows exactly what has to be done, why don?€?t we let SAC do that for the customer by default, out-of-the-box? With the new connector the number of object types (e.g. expense report, expense entry) will increase significantly from 2 up to ~15, which would also increase the number of manual steps to several hundreds.

*Requirements*:

Enable the Concur data acquisition work flow to pre-set all relevant steps by default (while still allow the user to change), i.e.
 * Predefined Concur queries, that show-up with the ?€?Use an existing query?€? dialog
 * Pre-selected Concur fields and filters, as default in ?€?Build Concur Query?€? dialog
 * Pre-defined Concur mappings and transformations in the ?€?Data wrangling?€? dialog, e.g.
 * ID + Description
 * CurrencyCode
 * Time dimension
 * Fullname = FirstName + ?€? ?€? + LastName


 * Pre-defined Concur model name (derived from query name, instead of a random name)
 * Pre-selected Concur import settings & schedules
 * Initial load
 * Delta load
 * synchronizing multiple import jobs for multiple Concur models

There are scenarios where one visualization is being driven by a measure and a dimension input??controls. There are invalid combinations of measure and dimensions for this visualization, where for??example looking at Operating Profit measure by Cost Center dimension does not make sense.??However, the story designer does not want to remove those options from the input controls since??all other combinations are valid and the story designer wants to give the flexibility to his end user??without sacrificing dynamic design or data.?€?

Expectation:?€?

I, as a story designer, want to specify the relationship between certain measures and dimensions to??prevent the end user from looking at invalid data.???€?

For the example, I would like to specify that Operating Profit measure should only be looked at by Profit??Center and Location dimensions ?€? so all other dimensions in the dimension input control would not be??available for selection, once Operating Profit measure has been selected from the measure input control.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello Colleagues,

We have a requirement as attached screenshot.??

Currently, we have enabled 'Measures' as options for customer to choose, for example, when customer choose ""Operating Expense/FTE"", the chart shows KPI ""Operating Expense/FTE by Cost Center"" this is make sense;??

However, once customer switch to measure ""Operating Profit/FTE"", then the chart shows KPI ""Operating Profit/FTE by Cost Center"", which does not make sense, we would like to show ""Operating Profit/FTE?? by Profit Center""; The dimension would be better changed according to meansures.??

How to realize it?

we thought an workaround, that enable 'Dimension' as option too, then customer can choose Measure, and then choose Dimension; But it doesn't friendly, because with current design, we cannot set linkage between Measure and Dimension, for example, once we select ""Operating Profit/FTE"", the dimension list should be refreshed and only show profit releated dimensions, such as ""Profit Center""??

??

Mercy Health is currently using Lumira Designer and linking from there to Explorer so the users can explore the data behind charts in more detail. When you open the BO explorer they have configured to show all the dimensions and measures and with the dimension members the occurrence count is displayed. We can rebuild this in the SAC Explorer if we have a measure available that counts the occurrences. The gap that we found is that we cannot persist the configuration of the Explorer in SAC.
 
The use case would be to enter as an end user, not as a story creator. The explorer behind the chart has been configured to show all measures and dimensions of the model behind a chart. When the user enters the explorer mode he will get to see all measures and dimensions, but if he wants to see a measure shown with each dimension member he has to configure it himself for every dimension. Even if he does it and then tries to bookmark this state, the measures behind the dimensions will have vanished the next time he enters.
 
We see two possible options for resolving this issue:
-	Add the option to add one measure to all displayed dimensions. This way the end user would have to make one selection and the count would be shown for all occurrences. (not optimal)
-	Make it possible for a story designer to configure the explorer view behind a chart with more details than just adding dimensions or measures to it. Optimally the story designer could add a measure to each dimension in the explorer and the end user already gets the desired view. This could be done in the explorer configuration in the builder or by creating a bookmark inside of the explorer that also saves the state of measures being shown.
 
Desired result when end user enters: All Dimensions and Measures are shown and a measure is shown behind the dimension members; This can be configured per dimension by a viewer and a story builder but cannot be preserved by either.

Screenshot 1

As soon as I even just switch between the different available views of the explorer, the measures behind the dimensions are lost. Same will also happen if I leave the story or the explore mode and reenter later.

Configuration of Explorer for a specific tile in Story Builder: Only possible to select Dimensions and Measures that will be available, not that a certain measure is displayed with a dimension

*Business Value*

Users on People Analytics advanced edition expect that a drill-to-detail function is available to breakdown the metric values in SAC stories to a list of employees that make-up the metric. This is one of the key capabilities of the current Workforce analytics product which advanced edition is replacing.
 * The primary reason for drill-to-detail need is to validate the metric (a particular number in a chart/table). Therefore the user need to see the list of employees which make up the metric.
 * The secondary reason is to explore the data further by slicing and dicing the detailed list. This is often done by downloading the data to excel and applying additional filters there. But with the SAC explore tool this option is now available within SAC.??

It is critical that the value shown in the chart/table is equal to the sum of the rows included in the Drill to Detail table. The whole point of drilling to details is to understand ""which employees make up this number"".

*Suggested approach to achieve drill-to-detail*

The??idea is to leverage SAC explorer as the drill-to-detail view. The SAC explorer already offer several advantages:
 * Explorer can be configured to show a list view by default (customers expect a list in the drill-to-details view).
 * Explorer offer additional filtering capabilities (slice & dice).
 * Explorer offer the option to export data (which is often a requirement from power users)

However, a few key capabilities are missing (each described in details in individual jiras):
 * The explorer view cannot apply filter to metrics. This is needed when we drill into metrics like ""terminations"" where only few employees have a termination. In this case we only want to see the employees that terminated - not all the employees in the cube. ??See FPA97-712.
 * The explorer view does not support the list table component. This makes the table view slow when a lot of dimensions are added to the view.?? See FPA97-713.
 * The initial explorer view??is not filtered to the ""clicked item"" in the chart.??So it does not behave as a true drill-to-detail (where a user can see what employees are behind a specific number in the chart). It simply opens up the??explorer with all the data behind the entire chart.????See FPA97-719.

A business case for this is;
 * As users can neither be deactivated nor have a validity end date, if their employment is terminated, the only option is to delete them from SAC
 * If they are not deleted immediately on termination
 * A user could continue to access SAC directly (not having to go via a company internal network)
 * This could possess a serious breach of confidential data
 * And provide the ex-employee the ability to perform malicious activities, such as download a report and email out to competitors / other parties


 * Users that are not deleted, will be counted as part of the user license number
 * If users are deleted immediately, via automated processes using a system such as SAP IdM,
 * Administration functions may not yet have been performed, which creates issues managing content in SAC
 * For example; user is an owner of a Story


 * A start Validity Date, gives the ability to pre-provision a user as part of the on-boarding process

Siemens in June requested to ""Change DISABLE_EMAIL to true in tenant config for Siemens productive tenant"" https://sapjira.wdf.sap.corp/browse/FPA35-42501??as all end-user always received emails when stories were shared or moved to another folder, which worst case ended in 4000 email notifications.?? This was done as a workaround until the feature ""email new recipient"" would be available with Q3.2019 / Q4 QRC.??

This feature will be rolled out soon for them and they already requested to??Change DISABLE_EMAIL back to false. But when testing in their preview tenant they saw that the feature??""email new recipient"" is by default selected. which would again send out emails when copying.??

We put it to very high, as it would be needed together with the QRC4 availability.

You need to highliught the chart again and then click on empty space 3. If you need to apply more than 1 filter - you need to go inside a chart, apply filter and then go back. Many clicks, every click is slow! 4. Then if need to remove such filter, you can not do from the main page, which means again few clicks Note: you can remove the filter at all on iPad! (works on iPhone) 5. You can not see in the story filters which filters are applied. Of course you can see it on the chart where it was applied, but it may not visible in the current scroll state. 6. What is the purpose of ""Others"" section in the Story Filter? 7. As a workaround for ""Guided analysis"" (to keep multiple filters on one page), JTI tried Hyperlinks option to jump to thre same page using selected data point and pass it to the target, but it does not work. 8.

when you have 10 points and a space of 10 cm, the system will equally spread the points over the available space.

what should be happening is ( like with timestamps ): the first 5 points need to be close together, the next 4 points needs to be further apart, as this is the correct time representation since the first 5 points are presenting a shorter period of time.

For timeseries charts with type: Timestamp the system does it correctly.

it should at least be an option that the user can activate.

After looking at the issue, the way I understand it is the customer has a dimension that has Data Access Control applied.?? They create an input control (page filter) on this dimension, but they create it as a static filter and still expect DAC to be applied. ??The dimension has multiple sources of info in the hierarchy (Joueurs, sponsors, Agents, Banques), but they only want to see Joueurs, and the only way to do this is a static filter. ??If this is the case, you are correct in saying a static filter will show exactly the settings that the story designer created the filter with, and the only way around is to use a dynamic ?€?All?€? filter.?? Chart and table filters (filters defined for specific charts, tables in the designer panel) only support static filters, so the customer would have to use story filters or input controls (page filters).

I tried combining multiple filters on the TIERS dimension, one static that only selects Joueurs and another which is dynamic all.?? Story filters selections cascade into other story/page filters and page filter selections cascade into other page filter selections. ??Unfortunately, the dynamic all filter will still show the entire hierarchy with only Joueurs enabled, so the customer would still see the other nodes in the hierarchy, they are just disabled due to filter cascading.

At this point I believe the request is actually for a feature, and would not be considered a bug fix, although we understand the customer?€?s position.?? Perhaps this could also be explored on the customer?€?s side at the database level to create a column that only contains Joueurs and then create a dynamic all filter on that dimension.

--

I realize that from a functional perspective is it not understandable, but given this is the current implementation, changes in behavior are considered an enhancement request.?? In the case of a dynamic all filter we are simply asking the data layer to give us back whatever has been configured for DAC and allowing DAC to handle the request. ??A similar situation for static filters would be where master data is deleted, but the filter contains deleted master data values, in this case the user will still see those values in the filter.

When no sorting is applied to Successfactors queries, then the results will be unreliable for queries with more than 1000 rows.

The behavior observed by customers is that the API appear to return random results which are different on every refresh.

The API has no default sorting.??And there is no way to know what default sorting to apply to a query. Therefore the feature must be one of the following:

Option 1: ""Manual approach""
 * End user must be able to specify sorting
 * End user must be must be made aware that applying sorting is required (as most users will not know unless the UI tell them somehow).

Option 2: ""automatic approach""
 * SAC??automatically apply sorting??on the ID-column of the first object selected for the query.??

At the moment we can decide who is admin, planner, viewer.... we can choose upon folder level who can edit or who is not allowed to edit...

What we are missing are the mixed possibilities within an organization.

You should also be able to define: can change objects of everyone, but also can only change objects created by the person himself.

So if the person is the owner of files within a folder, he should be allowed to change them, but not the files in that folder where the person is not the owner from. ( could be a authorization role setting: allowed to change every objects or only objects where the person is the owner from )

you should also be able to define this by team / folders.

For example: i could be owner of the HR team, allowing me to change everything in the folder of HR, but for finance i can only change the items where i'm the owner from.

so per team / folder you should be able to mix these.

Now once the Enduser changes the Top X (e.g. from Top 5 to Top 10) in one chart, i`d like the *second chart to change accordingly* as well. So after the change both charts would show Top 10 based on the displayed measure.

Second, this should also be able to *apply Top/Bottom* selection. So if we have two linked charts with Top 10 and the Enduser changes to Bottom 5, then in the second chart we should see Bottom 5 as well.??

Third, i would like to have a flag which allows to disable the Top/Bottom application and only refers to the number of entries. Example: I have two charts with the same measure. One shows Top 5, the second shows Bottom 5. Now if the Enduser selects to display Top 10 in the first one, the second would adjust to show bottom 10 as well. Same behavior expected when the user selects Bottom 10 in the second chart, then the first chart should adjust to Top 10. So in this case *only the Number of entries is considered* while in previous two cases also Top/Bottom would be applied to linked charts.??

If we want to have the superior solution we could even add a toggle function:

First chart shows Bottom 5, second shows Top 5.

Now if Enduser decides to show Top 5 in first chart, then each linked chart switches from the current active rank (Top OR Bottom) to the other one (so from Top to Bottom OR from Bottom to Top).

Settings of the Linked Analysis:

!https://influence.sap.com/sap/ino/xs/rest/common/attachment_download.xsjs/39137!

??

When the first filtering of Dimension A is performed, the selection is transferred to the table and the chart of Dimension B. The user now sees all entries for the selection, in this case a value of 217. In the chart of Dimension B we can see a reduction for the fourth entry from 32 to 27. The end user now wants to further investigate these 27 records.

!https://influence.sap.com/sap/ino/xs/rest/common/attachment_download.xsjs/39138!

When selecting the value of 27, the table and chart of Dimension A are updated to not display the value of 27. Instead, the filters have been restricted to the characteristic value of the value 27 and not to the combination of the selections made in the Chart of Dimension A and B.

Now we see the value of 32 in the table and within the chart of Dimension A.

!https://influence.sap.com/sap/ino/xs/rest/common/attachment_download.xsjs/39139!

The expected behaviour would be to analyse the data in the chart of Dimension A, filter it, all objects within the linked analysis are updated. Then analyse the data in chart of Dimension B and add a additional filter to the linked analysis.

The result would be that all object within the linked analysis are filtered for the selection of Dimension A and B. So the filters need to be cascading.

Expectation:

I, as a story viewer want to have an easy and intuitive way to access active values in a hierarchy input control

??

-------

Original Reuqest:??

For Input control with Cascading turned on, we see the Inactive Values grey out.?? Customers would like to have option to not see it on the list.?? When we have hierarchy with large numbers of dimension members, scrolling through potentially thousands of inactive values and trying to choose the active ones is a lot of effort for the user.

This happens quite often in Planning scenarios. If you bring Actuals and Budget into the same table, to input Budget data, you will get even more inactive members, when planning numbers are not yet populated.

Please see screenshots attached

In screeshot 1, when Q3 in selected there are 2946 inactive values (no data ?€? unbooked).?? It is a long list to scroll down to choose the active ones on the hierarchy.?? This is problematic.??

In screenshot 2 ?€? When we select Q4, without too much unbooked data, then it?€?s ok, but this is not always the case.

When using a table with only one measure and that measure is controlled by a measure input control, we would like to change the table behaviour when the measure is changed by the measure input control.

Now when you scroll in a table and change the measure, the table holds the current position. This is by design. But when using only one measure it would be better, when the table is scrolling back to the top of the table. Because in this situation you always want to start from the beginning.

Recreate the situation:
 # create a table grid with a measure input control (both measures at least 20 rows) and configure the table to display 5-8 record at once.
 # scroll to the next page of your table grid
 # change the measure by the input control
 # the table grid keeps the current row position

_What is the opportunity/problem the request_??_will address?_

After one changed the measure you start your analysis right in the middle of the table and at the end of you analysis you find that you overlooked some data and have to start over.

{quote}I believe some customer may want to use Custom Widgets from 3^rd^ parties?? from SAP Partners.

Even though they use integrity hashing method, they may feel uncomfortable to get the subresources from the outside of the SAC host.

??

My point is if we can hold those subresources in the SAC host environment, +At least, we can guarantee the custom widgets will not fetch any resources from the outside of SAC host environment.+

??

As of now, when we upload custom widgets into SAC, there is no clear path for icons and others.

So let?€?s say if SAC save js files and icon image in the specific location in somewhere in the SAC, why do we need to specify it in the source?

In the SAC code, we can fetch it from a specific folder with specific name using Custom widget name without specifying url.

The above shown workflow is too strict in the following situations:
 * User doesn't navigate back to the jump-off page, but laterally away from the target page to a different page. In this case the jump-off story filter isn't deleted automatically. Hence the dashboard might shows unexpected data that confuses the user.
 * In a dashboard where all pages are hidden except of the landing page, the user likes to use the ""back""-Button in the navigation bar to navigate back to the jump-off page. In that case the jump-off story filter isn't automatically deleted either. This is not consistent and confuses the user as well. Especially in embed-mode it takes a lot of clicks to manually delete the jump-off filter (please see attached video??[^Jump-Off.mp4]).

This backlog item should cover two enhancements:
 * the functionality for story designers to define whether jump-off filters should be deleted after lateral navigation.
 * Applying the ""Back""-Button in the navigation bar should always delete jump-off filters.

Regardless of which option is chosen, currently there is setup for each story / chart to enable the Drill to Detail view.

For Option 1 a Drill to Detail table must be generated for each story

For Option 2 even though a Default View is available for Explorer, the required view for Drill to Detail would need to be setup for each chart

A process needs to be developed to configure a Default Drill to Detail table or Default Explorer Filtered view to be used for all charts.?? All that would be required per chart would be to select it.

Our Korean customer SK Holding is asking for a performance improvement regarding query cancelation.??

*Business Reason*

Firstly, use review the first page, and then would like to turn to the second before the first page fully loaded. The system will by default still keep loading the first page and then come to load the second afterwards. This causes a performance issue and waiting time. User has to wait until the first page fully loaded even they just want to check second page for now.??

??
|*Current Behavior* |*Expected Behavior* |
|User view stories with multiple pages, sequential address has no issue (eg: showing page1, 2, 3 ?€?sequentially)
When user clicks another page while still opening current page, new page opens much more slower.
Guessing : current connection (max 6) is still on processing. In this point of time, if use move to another page then new requests will stack to queue.|If user explicitly open new page, then quit previous connection(queries) in processing and proceed new queries(for newly clicked page)|

*SAC users who run predictive do not have access to HANA database to create new views/ change views. All request must be submitted beforehand.

??

9.3.2?? Performance Optimization for Analytical Apps Use
As of SAP HANA 2, there is an option in SAP HANA System Replication to free up CPU resources by using a secondary SAP HANA node. SAP HANA allows an app to read data not only from the primary SAP HANA node, but also from a secondary SAP HANA node, which is usually anyway part of your system landscape as part of the high-availability strategy.
The secondary SAP HANA node is continuously supplied with all data posted on the primary SAP HANA node using a technique called log replay. The data on the secondary SAP HANA node has a delay of typically a few seconds compared to the primary SAP HANA node, depending on the current workload and other factors.
For analytical apps that only require read access, reading from the secondary SAP HANA node is a good alternative. It leaves more free CPU resources on the primary SAP HANA node to ensure smooth transactional processing. A number of analytical apps has now been enabled to read from a secondary SAP HANA node. The enablement means that the app is configured to accept data that have a slight delay compared to the data on the 
primary SAP HANA node.

For each chart/ table a Hyperlink must be setup to the Drill to Detail page.?? Dimension filters will be carried through to the hyperlinked table

*Gaps:*

The hyperlink does not support Measure or time values being passed through unless they are set as story filters

The navigation process back to the source chart after viewing the Drill to Detail rows, is not obvious.?? If the user simply navigates back to the original page the filters from the selected datapoint are retained.

Some user interface improvements are needed to make this clearer. For example, if the original assets could be accessed or at least its meta data (date of creation, created by user, published date) could be shown next it the draft copy.

Another idea is simply for the UI to give the user feedback that a copy is being made (when they edit it) and they are working on a draft copy.

I was contacted by the customer Barry Callebaut about an issue they are experiencing with their time series chart.

They have connected their SAC to a HANA live model. Their model contains both date fields and hierarchy as well as fiscal periods and hierarchies. Both of them are used in SAC in time series charts. For ""normal"" date fields this works well, not so for fiscal periods.

In their case, the fiscal period 5 represents January. The model does not contain any texts only the information about year and period: 2019005. The time series chart however automatically adds the text May as if assumes the field to be a month field. This might be a nice feature in some cases, here it makes the chart unusable.

Possible resolutions could be to add fiscal year support to models, where I can define an offset similar to import/planning models. This way smart charts like time series charts would know that fiscal period 5 is January and not May. Another option would be to be able to turn off the text in the time series chart. Either way the customer would really like to use the functionalities of the time series chart for fiscal periods.

In case there is a solution me and PM have overseen, please let me know.

Best

[Data Integration] Pre-define & synchronize multiple DA import jobs for multiple Concur models,FPA34-3096,5496390,User Story,Considered,FPA34,High,D035331,D036621,D036621,11/22/2018 13:52,11/11/2019 14:02,9/29/2022 9:56,,,,Data Integration,,,,,,,"*Issue as of today:*

A user who is setting up a data acquisition connection to Concur and defining data imports for all relevant T&E object types, needs to orchestrate multiple initial loads and delta loads for multiple T&E object types all on his own. All customers do the same again and again, so this is time-consuming and error-prone.

??

Example: Initial load for 5 years of historic data, each year with 800k items, a customer has to manually set up imports job
 * Using import method ?€?Append?€?
 * Query has to filter on time period, i.e ?€?from ?€? to?€?, e.g. by year
 * Customer has to guess, how many records per period and ensure it?€?s <800k (How can he know?)
 * Import has to be re-iterated for n subsequent periods
 * Customer has to do all this manually, e.g. five times
 * This has to be done for each model separately, e.g. for all 15 T&E object types
 * => Managing 5 * 15 = 75 import jobs, just to do the initial load!??

*Requirements:*
 * Provide an ?€?Initial load?€? mode for Concur import jobs
 * This shall automatically handle to append multiple chunks of data each <800k and reiterate with the next chunk as needed
 * See slide 9 / chapter 4.)


 * Provide an ?€?delta load?€? mode for Concur import jobs
 * This shall automatically use the known ?€?modified date?€? field/dimension to filter on ?€?since last import?€? and automatically use the known ?€?ID?€? field/dimension, while using the proper Import Method (clean and replace subset of data)
 * See slide 10 / chapter 5.1.)


 * Provide pre-defined schedule settings to refresh multiple Concur object types in the right order
 * See slide 13 / chapter 5.2.)

This affects both the novice user and an expert user of SF as the integration is a new concept. It makes the user unaware of the importance of the provided integration and a hindrance to the usage of the SAC capabilities.

_For example, if I would want to create a report or to import an existing report from the system, there is no guided help content available for me to understand the steps involved._

According to requirements, we need to import employee data from SuccessFactor, and finance data from S/4HANA Cloud (live), and in SAC we have to do data blending from these 2 data sources, to show integrated analysis, such as Revenue per FTE, Expense per FTE, etc.

So, we would like to check with you, if SAC plan to support *data blending between +S/4HANA Cloud live+ data source to +local+ (replicated*, such as SFSF) ?

We are leveraging SAC live data connection to consume S/4HANA Cloud Analytics Query Views, to build SAC Stories. Could you please comment whether it is feasible for SAC to support read association in CDS view?? in future?

For example, Lob Team is not willing to put ?€?PlantCategory?€? (VLFKZ) as an explicite field in SD views I_SalesOrderItemCube and C_SalesOrderItemQry, since VLFKZ is not part of SD tables. According to SD team's opinion, PlantCategory (VLFKZ) shall be retrieved via corresponding associations (via plant association to PlantCategory) in SAC via S/4HANA Live Connection.
Currently, It seems that the association is not possible to be consumed from SAC(SAP Analytical Cloud).
 I have attached the Email for discussion.

Thanks!

In addition as part of the use case, users should be allowed to edit the names of the custom groups / hierarchy nodes.

??

+Example from on-premise BI client solutions:+

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv839_dSc38]

*Note:* This??example should not be considered as a Table/Grid consumption requirement only for SAC. Proper UX design must be involved to delivery solution that meets both Design and visualization Consumption requirements for SAC.

??

+Example customer feedback:+

*Richemont*

Richemont expects the grouping functionality from Analysis Office, where you can essentially create a custom hierarchy by repeatedly??grouping dimension members into group nodes and dimension members and/or group nodes into other group nodes. It requires the ability to select multiple individual elements in a table and create a custom hierarchy on the fly, which would become part of the data model in the story. Richemont needs this to work for BW Live connections.

??

*Beiersdorf*

One of the first requests from their users was to be able to create custom/ user specific hierarchies/ groups directly in the stories. Details:
 - they will use BW Live connection, thus multiple users will work on the same model
 - they have multiple situations where their marketing users need to show for example: revenue from of top x products and the remainder should be showed in a category others. as the selection/ group/ hierarchy changes all the time they don't want to have to do these groups in the backend are on in the model, as they are different for different users.

??

*JTI*

Customer wants to create custom hierarchy with dimension members. Custom hierarchies won't be super complex, but this customer wants to take this further than just creating groups. Be able to re-use the custom hierarchy throughout Story visualizations.",1,1

 *IDEA:* show the current calendar day as default that the user knows the current format
 * as soon of typing the value manually the example value disappears
 * If user stops typing in the example value of today will be shown again.
 * Validation: should be done as soon the return button is pressed or the mouse is touching another field for insertion

This is some stunning good news for the clients we talk to.??

??

WHAT WE HAVE TODAY

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What we show is a story page with two sources : the first one (A) is the live connection, the second one (B) is the planning model that has the same dimensions as the live connection (or possibly less). It shows two objects: a graphic (A) and a planning table (B) that is the container for the comment,?? next to each other.??

When we change the value of an input control (that is common to both sources thanks to the link dimension) lke TIME , both sources start pointing to the new TIME value and we can start entering comments on the planning table for the A object for this TIME value.??

It's absolutely great for customers who say ""Only SAP is able to offer us to comment a graph made of the data of a live connection with true multi-dimensional data point storage""??

??

The benefits are??
 * People can comment the data from a live connection source (which is a frequent requirement with SAC BI to publishing financial figures for instance)
 * People can even comment charts, not only table data
 * The security??concept is strong: comments are in the cloud but only a secured story reconcile them with the data they refer to.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT WE NEED

The problem is this works ONLY if we have one dimension as input control or story filter. Whenever we have two of these filters or more, we have an error message that says

_*""Comments are not supported when a complex filter is in use""*_

??and we can no longer see any comment.??

This is a problem because it prevents us from selling planning license. People want to deal with at least 3 dimensions to filter on.??

??

Can you please developp this possibility asap ? Sorry to insist but it's not about fancy stuff but about a feature that would generate deals quite easily with planning license (including professional planning ones...)

Story viewer wants to open the story on the desired page. Today story always opens on page 1.

*Proposed Solution:*

Allow story viewers to bookmark the default opening page, instead of always opening the story on page 1. If viewer does not change the page, the default remains page 1.

When viewer creates a new bookmark, allow to select to set a default opening page.

*Idea Mock Up:*

See below the problems identified:
|UX Urgency|UX Topics|Issue|
|3|Configuring Objects|Why does ""Open Variance Panel"" create another variance? That is not what I expected. I already had a variance.|
|3|Configuring Objects|I have to click on ""edit variance in the chart header, then click on ""Edit in Variance Panel"" then click on Percentage and click 2 decimal places in order to get the variance to show as a percentage with 2 decimal places.|
|2|Feedback|It would have been nice to know that the variance option had been added somehow. Draw attention to it when it's added.|
|3|Bug|Granted, the drop down editor of the variance may have been a good, quick way to change my chart, but when it covers the chart, it's basically useless.|
|3|UI|These options for showing the variance as numeric or a percentage are very confusing. Like, if I have numeric selected, I can click percentage, And I cannot turn off numeric if percentage is not selected?€?.so?€?this looks like it should have been a radio button or something? There feels like there should have been a different control used.|
|3|Feedback|This warning does not explain what needs to be done in a very clear way. The user needs to have a particular time member selected in order to enable the system to create a variance against it. Order Date is the time dimension in this dataset that would be used.|
|3|Flexibility|I realized that somehow the adjustments I'd made for the variance for one of the charts was not correct when I had turned off all the chart header settings, so I had to turn them back on just so I could adjust the variance since ""open variance panel"" creates a new variance.|

|1|UI Challenge|OK button is not consistent with other panels with OK buttons in the Geo Layer editing panel.|
|3|workflow|I could not find where to change the basemap type after initial addition of the widget. Even after looking at the Detailed Instructions (which I'm not using), and reading the exact step (in words) ... still couldn't find it.....oh I was in Edit layer mode and the Builder panel has two modes.

Support standard unit of measure conversion,FPA34-6208,6903368,User Story,Considered,FPA34,Medium,D035331,D027296,D027296,12/5/2019 8:57,8/12/2022 21:24,9/29/2022 9:59,,,,Modeling ,,,,,,,"Unit conversion is similar to currency conversion but not each unit can be converted into each other unit. There are various groups of units and within each of the group they are convertible into each other - this means that conversion can take place only if the source unit and the target unit are part of the same group.??

According to the SI, there are seven basic SI system groups: meter (m), second (s), kilogram (kg), Kelvin (K), ampere (A), candela (cd) and mol (mol). Besides these standard units and groups, customers can create additional ones.??

In S/4HANA, there is a central unit of measures table - T006.??

*Requirements:*??

*UoM Standard Table*
 * Implement a central unit of measure table that groups units of measure into clusters of the same type.??
 * The different units that belong to one group have a linear relationship that allows the conversion between them and to the corresponding SI unit.
 * The units considered standard and belonging to the International Measurement Unit System (SI) should be populated by default in the Unit of Measurement table. Nevertheless, admin user should be able to add/integrate additional units of measurements and groups.
 * The conversion factor is defined by Numerator/Denominator fraction ratio.??
 * For some units of measure, the Numerator/Denominator ratio is not sufficient and a constant needs to be added, e.g. to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit you need to multiply by 9/5 and add 32.??
 * Each group should allow the selection of a Default Unit ?€? SI. This is the basis for the conversion from one unit to another. => this mode of converting within a group is used in S/4HANA T006. Alternatively, defining all possible source to target conversion factors could also be an option. The optimal solution for maintaining the conversion factors to be identified.??
 * The table should allow flexibility to add language translation at a later stage, in the same table or a separate table.

?? In the table below:
 * all units in the ""Mass"" group are defined in relation to KG, which is the standard/default unit.??
 * the Default Unit will always have the Numerator/Denominator ratio equal to 1
|h3. *Group*??*|h3. *UoM **|h3. *Numerator*|h3. *Denominator*|h3. *Default Unit (SI)*|h3. *Offset*|
|h3. *Mass*|h3. G|h3. 1|h3. 1000|h3. ??|h3. ??|
|h3. *Mass*|h3. KG|h3. 1|h3. 1|h3. x|h3. ??|
|h3. *Mass*|h3. TON|h3. 1000|h3. 1|h3. ??|h3. ??|
|h3. *Mass*|h3. OZ|h3. 56699|h3. 2000000|h3. ??|h3. ??|

??

*UoM conversion scope*
 * The unit of measure conversion should work for both stored and calculated measures.
 * The users should have the ability to define through configuration for each measure whether a unit of measure conversion should be applied or not.
 * I want a flexible variable control in the story to drive the unit of measure across multiple measures, but it should not be mandatory. I might want different target UoM for different widgets and data slices.??

SAC allows to export data into S/4 ACDOCP. Once you??ve configured an export, changes in the configuration are not possible afterwards.

It??s also not possible to create a copy of an existing export. For each single simple change you need to configure everything from scratch, which causes is big efforts.

There are 2 other topics connected with this, which makes changes necessary often
 * Filters cannot dynamically be applied based on dimension attributes (e.g. export only accounts with certain property set)
 * Version mapping cannot be configured based on a property of the SAC version

Our request is, to make the export configuration changeable or at least to start with a copy of an existing export.

Actually it is not consistently possible to reach to every UI element via keyboard tab.

As minimum scope we need the Story View Mode, the Homepage and the UI Shell around to work like that. (Official confirmation still pending on that)
 The goal is to ensure accessibility for disabled people which are using our software as an enduser. The keyboard accessibility also enables the customer to use ChromeVox as a Chrome extension to be able to read the contents which are highlighted on the screen.

The customer understands that bringing these capabilities to Edit Mode and Modeling etc. could be much more complicated.

What is exactly needed:

Keyboard Accessibility:
 # They have to access all items on a screen with keyboard??
 # They have to do standard left mouse click with enter (e.g. open the main menu, open a dropdown)
 # The order of our Widgets does not fit to the keyboard tabbing??

 Reporting (Reference Data) should be loaded from SAP BW via a Query to SAC.

For the CPM Market scenario around 800.000-1.000.000 data cells will be loaded for one planning year and one sales org.

The requirement is to have around 3 years loaded per sales org (previous year / current year/ next year) to mimic the corporate data model ""reference"" versions: Previous Year / Current Year - MPU / FRE / SRE / Budget / Actuals.

CPM currently works with 22 different SalesOrgs and the data volume is overall quite limited for that planning scenario as the data is aggregated to only:
 - 10 to 15 customers (Flight book structure)
 - ~20 materials per sales org
 - 12 months per year
 - 2-4 Versions (Reporting Scenarios) per Year
 - 5 Accounts (Financial Sales / Lump Sum / Per Unit / List Price / GSV)
 - 10 Dimensions

Nevertheless, it is not possible to load all the data via one job - the amount of data is too much:



!Image3.png!

+Issues:+

The data load jobs need to be split into smaller packages, loading one SalesOrg with 2 years seem to work fine.
 As the data should be updated on a regular base the different jobs need to be kept and changing only the filter (here Management Profit Center) is not an option as long as that can not be passed from outside to the load job:

!Image4.png!

Currently, the only option we see is to set up ~ 22 jobs (for each SalesOrg one job). The BW query could handle the years to be loaded via variables (always 2-3 years if the amount of data is not too much).
 Unfortunately, it is not easily possible to just copy a load job and change the filter - each load job creation needs certain mapping steps which can be quite a time consuming and??error-prone due to manual steps.

Today customer scenarios in SAC are more complex and usually involve a large number of story, page and widget level filters. There is a growing need for SAC Stories to help content creators and viewers to create, manage and modify filters with ease.

*Goal:*

Ensure the story creators are able to satisfy the desired filtering scenarios with minimal effort, without sacrificing the end viewers experience.

Ensure story viewers are able to understand, make selections and interact with filters in a intuitive and time- efficient way, increasing their overall productivity.

??
 * the underlying data model gets corrupted for some reason (we all know that this is a not completely unlikely scenario)
 * the underlying data model needs to be rebuild because of new business requirements
 * Siemens decides to migrate from NEO to CF
 * a major issue occurs with the tenant that necessitates to restore the tenant content using the backup

In any of these scenarios, the FocuS4 stakeholders want to be assured that the comments added to the story can be recovered and added to the rebuilt/recovered model. They further expect that the comments can be recovered after a delay of around 1 working day. (Recall: It took 3 weeks to recover models that had been incautiously deleted by the Siemens administration team in November last year). This issue has a higher priority for them than chasing for single lost comments. In fact, this is considered as a data security issue and by internal guidelines, the stakeholders are required to assure that the data is secure and recoverable at any time.

This requirement would be fully satisfied by making data-cell based comments transportable along with the model via the ACN network. The situation that the commentator is not a user of the target tenant must be handled in such a way that no comment gets lost. Preferably, the comment is still displayed in an associated story (e.g. with commentator displayed as ""Unknown"") and can be correctly associated to the commentator once she or he is added to the target tenant with the same user id as in the source tenant.",1,1

Today when a Time series Forecasting is done, there is the starting date/time, but not the ending date/time. In addition there is not the possibility to have an estimation of the training duration. Thus we can wait a long time to get the model train and we have to go very often in the status pane to check if the training is finished.

This is very is time consuming and not user friendly.

One thing which will help is to display the duration of the a training once finished and keep this information when we want to train the model again. This will give an indication of the time to wait.

If we chose to ever write out past predictions, the situation for comparing actuals and predictions will similar though.

In order to do those comparisons effectively, having all the different models in different versions is not useful and calculation of differences hard, since formulas become very complex due to the look-up logic what version to look in. SAP Controlling went through this exercise and was proposed a better solution by planning PM Holger Handel (cp. attached email)

Core of the proposal is to have customers not only choose a target version, but allow them to also choose a dimension member of some other dimension (""scenario dimension"") that allows them to differentiate those different modelling choices. This way all predictive model results could end up in the same version, but be differentiable more easily. Comparison formulas could then leverage standard formulas, lookups & filters that could then also be exposed in the respective story (the one planners use for comparing all those forecasts and their quality)??

_What is the opportunity/problem the request_??_will address?_

There's an existing analytic model based on file upload. The model contains different versions/categories. During the creation process, the name of this dimension is chosen unlucky. The user wants to rename this dimension. With other dimensions like account, organization and so on, it is possible.

In planning enabled models the version-dimension is shown in modeler-view and the description can be changed.

_What is the expected benefit?_

Less gap between functions that can be done in analytics models compared to planning models.

A??user doesn't have to recreate the model if the version-dimension should have another name. (better user experience)",1,1

Problem:??

The problem is that a Story cannot be saved without filling the mandatory prompts. Customer has situations where master data values/hierarchy nodes are not uniform across systems (for example GUIDs) in the landscape. If we save story with filled values and export /import to subsequent environments, the ""texts"" from source environment are retained in the story in target environment giving an impression to the users that prompt value is correctly selected (but under the hood, there is a GUID which is invalid in target systems). If user executes such story, they see no output. Allowing us to save story without filling mandatory prompts will force users to select correct values from value help in target system and solve this issue.

Other SAP tools are offering a setting to disable storage of prompts in the story/workbook.??

Current workaround is via user exits which has limitations (see email attached or BCP).

*current pain points from a viewer perspective (sorted by priority)*

1.) too many clicks to set variable values (described in [UX doc|https://jam4.sapjam.com/groups/Chqb0ov8hSKNRl9Ojas7BH/documents/HZnVQMOodd2UdV8AoC0b09/slide_viewer], page 8) see also??[^variable_change.mp4]
 * 1st click on the variable token in story filter bar (e.g. month)
 * 2nd click to deselect the current selection (with X button)
 * 3rd click on the value help button
 * 4th click to select the wished entry (e.g. month 2)
 * 5th click on OK button to confirm the selection,
 * 6th click somewhere in the story to apply the variable change.
 * This means it takes 6 clicks to change only one variable.

2.) width of variable tokens in story filter bar take up too much space. In case of many variables, users need to click on arrow buttons to get to the desired variable. This is same behavior as with story filter tokens.

3.) inconsistent filter bar UI (described in [UX doc|https://jam4.sapjam.com/groups/Chqb0ov8hSKNRl9Ojas7BH/documents/HZnVQMOodd2UdV8AoC0b09/slide_viewer], page 9)

*Prioritized list of improvements required by Telekom*

1.) An easy selection of variable values without UI brakes and less clicks is Telekom's number one requirement ([UX doc|https://jam4.sapjam.com/groups/Chqb0ov8hSKNRl9Ojas7BH/documents/HZnVQMOodd2UdV8AoC0b09/slide_viewer]??on page 65 tackles this)
 ?? ?? ??The below points are not finally elaborated in the UX doc yet:
 * Variable submit behavior:
 Will variables immediately be submitted on member selection, or will there be an apply button? If button, on which level (variable level, or variable list level)?
 Goal should always be as less clicks as possible but also number of variable submits in case of expensive queries need to be considered
 * Support of different variable types:
 Telekom use single, multi and hierarchy selection variables. These types should be supported in an easy to use UI as described in the UX doc.

2.) A compact list of variables is Telekom's number two requirement ([UX doc|https://jam4.sapjam.com/groups/Chqb0ov8hSKNRl9Ojas7BH/documents/HZnVQMOodd2UdV8AoC0b09/slide_viewer]??on page 63/64 tackles this)

A. Linked dimension dialog misses manipulated dimension (see example in attachment)

As a user within a story, I want to create a linked dimension between two models. One model has an active hierarchy, the other model is flat. I set a dimension of the primary model from hierarchy to ""flat presentation"" via a widget. Within the linked dimension dialog, now the ""flat dimension"" gets still recognised as a dimension with hierarchy. This allows to create the link based on description only. -->Expected behaviour: possibility to choose between ID and description

Data lock status change should respect the hierarchy in a more strict way,FPA34-5483,7482749,User Story,Backlog,FPA34,High,I818705,I032684,I032684,4/17/2020 4:11,4/26/2022 15:13,9/29/2022 9:59,,,,"Planning (Allocations, VDT, etc.)",,,,,,,"Dear colleagues,

The current behavior for data lock status change can be summarized as:
 * The responsible person for a leaf members, will be able to change the data lock status from?? 'Restricted' to 'Locked'. And once this is done, that responsible person will NOT be able to change the status back to 'Open' or 'Restricted' unless that user is also the responsible person for the parent node.
 * Any user who's the responsible person for a parent node in the hierarchy, will be able to change the status from 'Locked' to 'Open' or 'Restricted' for any leaf members under the corresponding parent node.

This means one user could override the locking decision made by his/her manager.

Using the below simple hierarchy as an example:

?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ??Person Responsible

?? ?? NA?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? Aaron

?? ?? ?? ??|- USA?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? Ben

?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ??|- California?? ?? ??Charlie

After Aaron locks all members under NA, Ben as the responsible person for USA, he may still be able to unlock all leaf members under USA.

Some customers is looking for a more strict way to control who can or can't change the data lock status. Especially the user should NOT be able to override the decision made by his/her manager from the hierarchy perspective.

Of course, this may leads to another requirement.

Right now, the lock status for a parent node is calculated based on the status for each leaf member. For a locked parent node, the system can't tell whether it's because all leaf members have been locked, or the manager just locked the parent node directly.

So maybe a new locking status can be introduced to differentiate the above two cases. And this new status can be used to decide whether the responsible person for the child node (not leaf member) can still change the status.

Based on the feedback from customers and partners, we're looking for the enhancement in table grid to allow user change or update dimension members directly.

So far, in planning, user is allowed to change or update the measure. But the dimension members are not allowed to be changed.

But when the feature to add new members in table is introduced, user is now allowed to add new entries in the table directly. This will leads to the requirement to change the dimension member in table grid for different reasons:
 * some mistakes were made when add a new entry by selecting the wrong dimension member
 * some dimension members can't be decided when the entry is created, which needs to be updated later, user has to choose one default value first when create the entry

Of course, user can assign the measure to a different member afterwards. But when there're multiple measures in the table, the manual work become complicated to users.

Please check it.

Thanks a lot and best regards,

*Use case*:

We are using SAC to prepare for our HEC customers the information regarding performance of the systems.

There we have to use different (multiple) dimensions, but one dimension (system host) is too long to show the whole value on the x-axis.

Switch the chart orientation to horizontal is not accepted from a look and feel. We need therefore the possibility to use for the x-axis the diagonal orientation (e.g. definable for each used dimension) also if I have more than one dimension - see attachment",1,1

The request has come from different sources - Presales , Application and SAC OEM/Embedding teams when their customers and partners ask for Smart Discovery feature from existing application UI.

In case of Unilever, there is an obvious scenario with Ariba as currently they are manually uploading the HANA data (coming via Ariba) into SAC and then manually uploading the output of Simulation to Ariba app. This creates issues in the process as it is time consuming, in-efficient and does not allow Unilever to close the loop with Ariba. Ideally they would want to start and end in Ariba with SD available for viewing and defaulting the Event parameters by Ariba user.??

Possible Options of investment:

1) Today the OEM license of SAC does not include any Smart Features. In case of Smart Discovery, if story is embed-able in this mode , why not Smart Discovery?? ?(To be verified) I think this will be mostly a quick win but licensing issue.

2) Smart Discovery integration with URL API, the URL API had worked for 'View SD' as this acts like a Story. But there was a request for URL API to launch or create new SD as well.

3) APIs for Analytics Designer

4) Integration Scenario compliance so appropriate embedding is achieved like other application features . Please note: we know today Ariba does not have any embedding scenario but one is planned to be released in 2020 in SAC based on OEM Integration Service .

The client works in a secure industry, and data is not allowed to leave their network. File upload to a cloud is considered a security breach and may lead to the SAC toolset not being adopted??

The customer would like to:
 # Allow user to create stories in their personal (private) folders.
 # Whilst blocking users from uploading external files to either private or public folders.

It is possible to grey-out the ?€?file upload?€? button in the toolbar, by de-selecting both the create ?€?private files?€? and create ?€?public files?€? permissions.

However, this has the side-effect of disabling the self-service capability of SAC entirely, by relegating the user to a ?€?viewer?€? role.

To confirm again: the customer wants to turn off the ?€?file upload?€? feature for both private and public folders, whilst retaining the ability to create stories in both private and public folders.

The current requirements for disabling the ?€?file upload?€? button removes the self-service option for end-users by defaulting them to read-only access in folders. Meaning: No personal copies of reports and no self-service aspect.

The knock-on effect is that it makes a super-user concept much more difficult to realize, by increasing the complexity of folder permissions, including a deeper reliance on a central administrative function, which is an undesirable overhead and the maintenance of which the customer cannot sustain.

What is required is a more granular security setting: i.e. decouple the ?€?create file?€? permissions from the ?€?file upload?€? capability. Simply put: a separate permission is needed to control the file upload functionality.

The customer has had to implement a workaround of using a proxy server to prevent specific file extension types be uploaded from their LAN to the internet. The experience is sub-optimal, with a higher TOC, and SAC hangs if the exploit is attempted.",6,1

Roche (pre beta feedback, Feb 2020)
----------------------------------------
In term of output versions (write-back), it would be faster if public versions can be selected to directly write-back the predictive forecasts. It would avoid the extra step to write back to private versions and then have to move the predictive forecasts from private versions to public versions. So the life-cycle management of predictive forecasts will be simplified. Anyway private versions for output are good enough for the beta

The [planning demo for Sapphire 2020|#;view_id=story;storyId=194502F6622A3E64174875126D2B72BE]] integrates predictive and planning for revenue forecasting. Since forecasts are written to a private version that can only be shared by the version owner, sharing the demo is unnecessarily complex: every new user needs to get the private version shared by Sead (=owner), putting burden on him and making the demo not scalable.??

+ASML (June 2020)+

This morning I met with customer ASML. They are fully buying Predictive Planning ?€? end to end. We just discussed use case / implementation plans, no fancy slides. They are ready to roll once the feature is there on their tenant.

They want to do predictive forecasts for regions combined with product groups (actually the Gartner demo use case). This is about cost (of billable services). ??

They are working with a partner called element61. They seem to have a degree of planning expertise, but I cannot fully judge this. Also the ASML people are to the point & working as business process owners (finance dpt).

??There is ?€?just?€? one point that they raised which is annoying to them.

This topic is write-back into private versions. As of now Smart Predict only writes backs to private versions (and the versions need to be created beforehand in stories).

Their mindset is automation. They are thinking how they can flow predictive forecasts directly to end-users (hence public versions). I warned them there needs to be a ?€?human in the loop?€?. This being said, I love their mindset.

In their mindset, the way to automate the workflow is Smart Predict writes back directly to public versions (Sead alluded to this topic a few times).

??In the current version it imposes them either to make the private version public (but then you need to recreate the private version each month when you do a new forecast run).

Or they could use a data action to copy (?€?copy step?€?) the predictive forecasts from a private version to a public version (and monthly overwrite the private version with new data).

This could be combined (chained) with an allocation (?€?allocation step?€?) if need be.

+ASML (October 2020)+
Finally, there is sometimes no need for the features offered by private versions, and the need to use them is introducing a lot of unnecessary complexity both technically as functionally. E.g. why not just run prediction directly on public version.
[Antoine] Just for me to make sure I understand, when you say ?€?run prediction directly on public version?€? am I right to understand that you refer to the version where the predictive forecasts are being written back? As for the versions that are used to train the predictive model, public versions can be used already today. This is another interesting ask ?€? and I would like to kindly ask you if you can raise it to our enhancement request platform.

+Roche (March 2022)+

A real improvement of the SAC predictive planning process that was introduced with the MultiActions was the possibility to save the predictive forecast to a *public* planning version. Earlier the Smart Predict result could be saved to a private??version only. Afterwards, it was required either to manually publish the private version to a public one or to use a data action for making the data public.

A suggestion for improvement for Smart Predict would be to allow saving the predictive forecast to a public version also in predictive scenarios.

Currently if this hierarchy is brought into SAC even though in the model an ID and Description are populated, only the LOWEST level will show both ID and description.

All other levels will only show an ID (I assume this is because it's being looked at as a 'property' aggregation).

??

_Please describe your improvement request_

On the fly Master data creation in SAC is possible by end users in the table widget (right click > add member), but end-users have to enter the master data code (ID) themselves. However, this is a 'free-text' ID, so often not in line with the intended (IT) model standards.

We are in need of an 'auto-increment' feature where the master data just counts upwards.
E.g. when adding new product master data, if the??highest??product id is '612', then the next should be generated as '613', etc. And this should be??*concurrency proof*??if any other end users are planning at the same time. And the 'free text' should still be possible in the description of the product itself.

Also, the table widget is not always user friendly when a lot of properties have to be provided, and some of them are mandatory & need proper values (validation) for the SAC planning & calculation features to work correctly.
Validation of property values can be: a numeric value, a percentage, a date/time picker, a certain amount of characters, an existing member of another dimension, etc.
It would be better if a standard 'wizard' screen can be made available that guides end users in the master data create process. Or at least if this could be scripted somehow in SAC Application Design.

And SAC is also missing the possibility to 'update' existing master data. Only 'new' master data can be added, so mistakes after creation cannot even be corrected at the moment.

_What is the opportunity/problem the request_??_will address?_

Easier & Fool-Proof Master Data creation on the fly during the planning process.

_What is the expected benefit?_

Less user training needed, less error-prone planning process.
Greater SAC adoption in many different planning areas requiring master data creation.
Concurrent creation of master data is often an issue in planning (BPC) implementations at the moment.",1,1

Sorting by measure on a stacked chart does unexpectedly does not order by the totals in some cases,FPA34-5405,7397629,User Story,Open,FPA34,Medium,,I819634,I819634,4/1/2020 1:07,2/18/2022 18:44,9/29/2022 9:59,,,,,,,,,,,"When sorting on a measure in a stacked chart (bar/column, or combined stacked bar/column), the sort order appears to sometimes be wrong.
h2. HANA

For example, this chart based off EMPLOYEE_PERFOMANCE:

!image-2020-03-31-17-37-44-548.png|thumbnail!

See that the ""Intensification Nano"" category has a smaller total than ""Min Max Crossfit Tee"", however, it is nevertheless ordered higher.

The reason this is occurring is:
 # Totals in the stacked charts aren't part of the query or calculated by the back-end, the chart generates them based on the returned resultset
 # The back-end sort does not take totals into account (at least as the query is defined today), it's based on ordering the dimension on colors values, which then sorts the dimension on the axis.

InA request sort definition for the above example:

!ina_req_sort.png|thumbnail!

Notes:
 - This is quite an old limitation that must have been introduced when Sort was first implemented for charts within SAC, and it didn't account for how sorting may need to be different depending on different chart types and whether the back-end would support this requirement
 - Rank currently also has the same limitation but this should be addressed by: FPA00-4350
 - Sort may not lend itself so the same solution, and we'd need to have a solution that would work across InA providers (MDS, BW, etc)
 - Generating the same query in Table, also results in effectively the same behaviour:
 !table.png|thumbnail!

The feature would require switching existing sort behaviour to try and leverage a simple measure sort in InA:
 !sort_by_measure.png|thumbnail!
h2. Cause

According to MDS colleagues, this would sort Date(YEAR) by the values within the PRODUCT_NAME group, and the PRODUCT_NAMEs by the total over all YEARs within the group.
 Also, if you would have another dimension on the columns, this dimension would also then be sorted by the overall total over the rows. This also means that it's _critical_ that the visible totals and non-visible totals need to match up.

For example, in the EMPLOYEE_PERFORMANCE example above, MDS calculates the total for ?€?Min Max CrossFit Tee?€? as 107.568. Since this differs from the visible total, something special must be going on with that measure. If you check the model, the measure is defined as QUANTITY*UNIT_PRICE in the underlying view. Since there is no exception aggregation defined, the formula is calculated after the aggregation, meaning:
{code:java}
SUM(QUANITITY)*MAX(UNIT_PRICE) = 996 * 108 = 107.568{code}
NOTE: The model also specifies MAX aggregation for UNIT_PRICE!

We can fix this by changing the sort that we send to the back-end, however, in the majority of cases this does work and may hide a root cause that is due to the how the underlying measure is calculated.
h3. Troubleshooting
 - To determine if the customer is seeing this issue, you can try removing the dimension on the color shelf and check the visible totals before and after:
||BEFORE||NO DIM ON COLOR||
|!screenshot-2.png|thumbnail!|!screenshot-4.png|thumbnail!|

 - You can see that the total value on the right is greater than the left, and this value is what drives the sort order for the back-end and is due to the flawed calculation

h3. Workaround
 - If the customer doesn't want to change or fix the calculation to ensure that the visible total matches calculated total, then it's possible to address this by:
 ## Creating restrictions measures on each of the dimension members in the color shelf
 ## Creating a calculated measure that sums each of the RMs
 ## Sorting on the calculating measure from the previous step
||BEFORE||WORKAROUND||
|!screenshot-3.png|thumbnail!|!screenshot-5.png|thumbnail!|

h2. BW
 - Currently (as of 2021.02) and earlier thus far, we send a simple measure sort which will not try and preserve the grouping:
 !screenshot-6.png|thumbnail!
 - As a result, stacked totals are not honored and instead the chart is sorted on the dimension with the largest slice (as if break grouping was on):
 !screenshot-7.png|thumbnail!

h3. Workaround
 - Using the 'unbooked' data option on the color dimension will also implicitly send sorts on the dimension on the category axis and on color, which helps correctly preserve the order, see FPA22-19362:
 !screenshot-8.png|thumbnail!

h3. Note
 * Discussed this issue with BW-InA team, their response is that the default OLAP behavior to sort based on aggregation only when 'totals' is enabled for the dimension. However, this leads to a discrepancy between BW and HANA because MDS does not require sending the 'totals' in the query to sort on totals for multiple dimensions, instead it is preserve grouping by default for sorting on stacked dimensions. If we enable break grouping for HANA we'll see the same behavior as on BW.

Use Smart Discovery for financial and planning use cases

??

*Key Capabilities:*
 * Support for exception aggregations as a target to Smart Discovery

??

*Rational*

Further example of where the Smart Discovery example is broken.?? Average Ave Aggregation are a normal modelling practice especially in financial or planning cases. A good reason does not exist for this not to be supported it was a result of the original implementation.

Horrible workaround?? exists of creating duplicate measures in the model and doing work on the generated content to resolve it like in Gartner Bake Off example and internal PXD Project.??

Without resolving it it will be difficult to access if Smart DIscovery is useful or just a demo feature.

*TODO:*??Surprised at the lack of evidence will look though notes for more references.??

_Direct feedback from Unilever._

Unilever?? expressed a need of different aggregation other than default SUM for target variables as charts on overview page for example will not make sense to analyse the information with default SUM aggregation.

Example of this are: Price compression % (changing price ratio from start to end ) for Unilever or 'Age' for Exxon-mobil.??Seeing the TOTAL price compression or TOTAL age and forecast for next months is also meaningless in smart discovery.??

As a workaround, Unilever has thought of addressing this problem?? by applying exception aggregation to get Average and not SUM. Other charts in smart discovery which are not related to predictive engine do get updated as a result . But the major issue is once they apply exception aggregation for a measure, they can't select that as a target as it is not supported by Smart Discovery. See screenshot.??

Ask here is to enable Smart Discovery for such measures. It is not a calculation and nothing changes in underlying data but it is to make the results more meaningful.",1,1

*Today Value prop of Simulation tab in SD is testing new observations. However, there is a difference between testing a combination of 15 features that does not exists in the training set but is plausible vs testing an observation that contains a pair of values that is highly unlikely (in the statistical sense) and that is actually impossible (in real life). If Dublin is always associated with Ireland in the estimation set, and if you have a large enough set of observations how Dublin, it is highly unlikely that Dublin may be associated to other countries in europe in validation or real test sets**. The point is that the ML algorithm will likely leverage the statistical association of Dublin with Ireland. If the goal is to predict a salary, then ML could create a model where salary depends a lot on Country (Ireland has a high GDP per capita), and a little bit on City (salary adjusted to reflect the higher cost of living in Dublin vs Galway). Now if you want to simulate the effect of a relocation on Salary, and if you only edit the City (Dublin -> Geneva) ??and forget about editing the Country, the model might predict no difference (both cities are large in their respective countries, so the City adjustment may be close) whereas the salaries in Switzerland and Ireland may be different => you get an untrustworthy prediction about an impossible observation. We can say that the end-user made a mistake, but the tool does not alert about the pitfalls.*

*Moving forward, today we mostly deal with flat files. When we?€?ll support live +analytical+ datasets, we?€?ll encounter columns coming from BI hierarchies, with strong constraints between levels. I think that in the future, the simulation panel would bring value by enforcing the hierarchy consistency in the same way BI tools enforce consistency when answering prompts for a hierarchical variable : either by displaying a tree for picking values, by filtering list of values from already answered levels of the variable hierarchy or by alerting about inconsistent combinations.*

*To me correlations are very helpful to understand both the data and the behavior of the model. For Unilever, it could have alerted about the correlation between No_of_Suppliers and No_of_Bids. This resulted in confusing outcomes when No_of_Suppliers was edited in the Simulation Panel without adjusting No_of_Bids at the same time, thus simulating atypical cases where bringing in more/less suppliers has no impact on the total number of bids. By doing that, Unilever got correct but confusing/useless outcomes from the model.*

*The APL already computes correlations, and my understanding is that Smart Discovery internally computes functional dependencies, which are other interesting insights about the data.*",1,1

 * The user is also given the ability to create new views in SAP Analytics Cloud Explorer
 * The user has the ability to save the exploration view

+Issues:+

+1. Commenting Widget not available for ""Analytic Applications"" - only in Stories+

+2. When adding a Commenting Widget to a story, the story creator needs to already define (filter) which dimension values are to be commented on+ - minimum filter: account (key figure) and version.
!Image11.png!
 The commenting widget reacts on the story filters:

!Image12.png!

When changing the story filter to another version (eg. Actual) the comment is gone
!Image13.png!
 That the comment is gone is fine as the user commented on different story filters but that the comment widget ""header"" is fixed to what was selected when the widget was created (here: List Price for MPU"") is misleading for the user.
 Is the??comment widget filter only responsible to show the header text or does it come with other limitations?

Overall it would be good to fully remove the filters in the widget and only have a ""free text"" as sometimes the user would also comment on the full dataset he planned without limiting it on a certain account (here: Listprice)

+3. Comments are not available for models having variables+
 A mid-range complex planning solution for multiple users relies on variables. Variables can be bound to data action triggers/planning sequences. 
 Without variable support, comments can't be used properly.

+4. No comments supported on live data sources (eg. BPC)+
 This is a big disadvantage for a live data connection.

When we first developed S/4 Hana connector to connect to SAP Gateway, we initially hardcoded the OData clients to have the paths: https://<s4system>/sap/opu/odata/sap/<ODataService>

I do not remember the exact reasoning for this but I have heard it was because S/4 initially did not allow their customers to customize the client paths (bolded above) but now they allow customization. When customers try to select their OData clients, the S/4 plugin tries to connect to the wrong URL as it is hardcoded. 

This is affecting other customers as well (FPA27-12662 being another example) but Siemens is currently our biggest customer encountering this problem.  Expect more customer issues are likely to come as more customers choose to customize their OData client paths.

For the SAC, embedded edition its important to provide the capability of stopping and staring the service instance as required by the customers/partners without loosing any of their investment e.g stories, models and analytical applications created while the service was up and running.

This feature allows to control the TCO for the customers/partners while they are in development phase and would provide us competitive edge.

Following are the two option discussed with engineering, next step is to do a task break down of the both the approaches and provide a high level feasibility and effort estimation

* Simply provide start/stop capability to service consume, but keep tenant as is except blocking frontend access to tenant, e.g. by setting the number of concurrent sessions temporarily to 0
* On stop of tenant store configuration and content in CAN, on start of tenant import configuration and content from ACN. This feature might require tenant move capability as well, because on tenant start the previous system might already be completely booked

[NLQ] Support for comparison questions,FPA34-5217,7224531,User Story,Open,FPA34,Medium,I311255,,,2/26/2020 23:29,11/22/2021 16:57,9/29/2022 9:59,,,,Smart Assist,,,,,,,"*Background*
 Comparison questions are arguably some of the most common business questions that get asked. For example;??
 * *Version comparison questions* - What is the actual headcount compared to plan
 * *Time comparison (Period on period) questions* - How does sales revenue this quarter compare to last quarter
 * *Time comparison (Same period compared to last year) questions* - How does sales revenue this quarter compare to the same quarter last year
 * *Population comparison questions* - How does average salary compare between males and females

When searching using comparison questions?? most users expect to see part of the search results displayed as a variance. For example the question 'What is the actual headcount compared to plan in 2020' the user expects to see 3 values returned 1) actual headcount, 2) planned headcount and most importantly 3) *variance between planned and actual headcount.*??
 Today in S2I not only does NLQ not recognize the comparison intent it actually returns zero returns in some cases!

For example search 'sales revenue this year compared to last year' returns zero results as sales revenue is filtered in 2020 and 2019.

*Goals for this epic*

The goals for this epic are
 * Have NLQ support comparison questions
 * Have NLQ search results show the value for the 2 comparators (ie 2 measures or time periods) as well as the variance between them

*Some DRAFT UX mockups of how to show variance in S2I are* here??[https://jam4.sapjam.com/groups/Chqb0ov8hSKNRl9Ojas7BH/documents/sR4XOmWO8HWrfiIAfcFSb4/slide_viewer]??

Good morning Ian : )
We don't have a public API for S2I today. I'm curious what they mean by structured format
??
Thanks Saeed. I didn't think so. I will find out what they mean by what they expect in terms of a structured format.Any thoughts on the embedding front (question 2?)


The only option available is to use App Builder to build an application that uses (search API exposed as set of functions + bind it to visualization control).. then embed this app in other containers.
??
I doubt we can create a chat bot using App Builder.??the best contact is Jove shi (whom i worked with to expose S2I functionality in App builder).??He's the manager of app builder team
??


Yep that makes sense Saeed. Thanks much. At the end of the day it sounds like the simplest approach would be to create a simple analytic app with S2I in it only that is embedded in a custom app container. From your perspective does this sound super hacky or is this a valid approach??? I would have thought some sort of direct API & embeddable S2I component would make more sense but maybe having the analytic app wrapper isn't that big a deal?Thoughts?
??


It is a valid approach TODAY.???? Embeddable Search + explorer container to come in future where we control the experience.??basically embedding the analysis workbook in external applications and have an adaptable UI??(edited)??

With this said relying on Business users to declare the visualization type in their query (using keyword 'as')?? is unrealistic.?? Instead we need to provide smart, Best Practice Visualization (BPV) defaults for the business user based on the measures & dimensions matches when they searching.??

Doing this helps the Business User immediately understand the S2I result by helping them more easily detect the patterns in the data.

This also is also expected and needed to make us competitive. Tableau has had features like show me for a while.

*Goals for this epic*
 # *Improve the BPV that is used for the search results based on users search term & matching entities?? -* so that we improves the overall quality of the search results. For example if the users search term;
 ** matches 1 measure and 2 dimensions then show as stacked bar by default
 ** contains a time based dimension default to line and show trailing 12 months by default
 ** contains a numeric based dimension - consider auto-binning as histogram by default
 ** contains a geo dimension use Geo map by default
 ** more examples tbc. Christina to define

*Note:* I captured a few examples as stories attached to this epic when playing with the product. This is not holistic.?? I also think Flavia did a great breakdown of what the defaults should be.


 # *Recommend alternate ways to visualize the search result* - so in the case that we get it wrong in the above case recommend an alternate way to visualize the same result so that Business Users have a way to change how its visualized. I think this use case is less valuable than the first.

Ability to allow a tenant administrator to understand the storage usage within a tenant.

As an administrator I want to be able to view the usage of storage within my tenant. This should be everything (regardless of how we store in the underlying system).

I expect to be able to view storage used overall, by user, object, time (MVP and other dimensions (nice to have).

Should be a simple view, easily to vitalize (tree map or similar).

As an administrator I should be able to take action based on the information. Delete large objects (and dependencies), delete unused/orphaned content etc.

If we commercialize this then we would need to ensure data is passed to SAP licensing systems

??

Why:-

Datasets and improved data acquisition capabilities have allowed customers to easily create large volumes of information. Deployments are growing as the solution matures and customers add more users and content.

New features such are archiving/versioning will increase storage needs rapidly.

Cost to SAP will increase as customer deploy.

We cannot commercialize/enforce any storage limits if we cannot measure storage. First we need to instrument so we can measure what we use today, then add enforcement, if we decide to commercialize.

??

Background:

The original supplemental agreement has never contained a limit_, it was considered as guidance only_ as there was no technical measurement or enforcement mechanism. It could not be measured by either us or the customer in any meaningful way. It was also unclear what was meant by ?€?storage?€? as there was no definition or explanation, and it originally stated memory and then was changed to storage.

??

Hence removal of this language, as commercially/legally it was not viable to have a clause we could neither provision, measure or enforce.

??

The current statement form the commercialization team when asked if we could add storage clauses back into the agreements is that any storage limit clause _cannot be added_ (commercialized) unless we can provide a way to both measure and enforce whatever it is we are commercializing. So if we decide it is ?€?storage?€? we need to be able to define, measure (and make this measurement available to customers), and have an enforcement mechanism for this limit within the product.

It should also be noted that we must be able to physically provision whatever it is we are commercializing (selling) so if we sell a 5Tb storage option we should be able to actually deliver this, there is a commercial/legal risk if we sell something we cannot actually deliver).

??

We know today there are technical limits and architectural constraints (HANA memory only used by SAC, tenants cannot be moved (easily) to free up additional storage, multiple tenants on small HANA systems etc).

Potentially hana 2.0 will lift/ease these, but that is still July 2020 or beyond and there are no guarantees.",1,1

*Reasons*:
* It's most likely that the user wanted to create this artifact in this folder and not in his ""My files"" which are offered at the moment. 
* It behaves like other tools. In Windows Explorer or similar tools, when you Add something while being in some folder, the something is added to this folder rather than somewhere else

I create this ticket on behalf of S/4HANA Cloud, my contact is [~D032467].

The problem S/4HANA Cloud has with the embedded SAC is the following:

In SAP internal development environment requirements differ from customer use case. In the area of embedded OEM SAC for SAP S/4H CL currently no automatic user provisioning for SAC is intended. We have various ways, how users are handled based on the connected SAP S/4H client.

So if a user tries to access the SAC tenant and does not have a related user in the SAC user store, he gets a screen with a link sending a standard eMail to the tenant owner eMail-address. This is not a feasible support channel for SAP S/4H dev environment. Therefore we would like to have the ability on the login-screen to enter tenant specific information, how user request are to be addressed for a dedicated SAC tenant.

This would be a requirement for canary ?€? usually used for SAP S/4h CL dev and correction environment, and prod ?€? usually used for SAP S/4H CL maintenance environment.

In an ideal world this could as well be parametrized ?€? that we have some n variants, e. g. html or ascii pages, which we ?€?assign?€? to the dedicated tenants. So in case of a required change, we would not need to adapt it for all tenants, but only in the related template, which is shown ?€?real-time?€?.

It gets very dangerous where Public Dimension have been modified on the tenant & then another user who does not know or understand that run an import from the Content Network.

It is a problem for us on P&A Demo tenants for Planning demos. We have SEs follow a process for PreDemo steps in order to ""reset"" the data in the models to the starting point for the demo. This means the SE logs in with a user ID assigned for that demo. He downloads from a SharePoint folder we provide a link to that contains a tgz export file. That file contains the models used in the demo with their data at the starting point for the demo.

Thus that user ID which can a deployment/import thus has access to Content Library & a rogue SE can run an import even though they have been told not to.??

SAC is very vulnerable to this happening inadvertently even more so now that models can be renamed. A model may have been renamed on a tenant but to SAC it is still the same object and if an import is run from the Content Network it will overwrite the object if that option is selected. Because the object was renamed on the target tenant the user may not realize it is the same object.

We also have the problem that users (especially Internally) do a miserable job of naming objects (e.g. models, dimensions, stories) & giving them a good description so they are easily identified. This makes it all more likely objects will get overwritten by a Content Network import as it gives you a limited view of the objects to import.

??

We should have 3 different permission settings.

??
 * Content Network
 * Deployment/Import
 * Deployment/Export

??

Only selected Admins would have Content Network permission

Separate Deployment Import & Export would be beneficial.

Additional experienced users would get the ability to run an import under deployment.

This would support following a standard IT methodology of have 3 tenants, Master, Test, & Production. Of 2 tenants Master & Production.

More users could be give Deployment/Export capability as that is the least dangerous setting.",1,1

Due to this bug (https://sapjira.wdf.sap.corp/browse/FPA56-4165), the member order must be sorted in order to merge the queries. If this is not the case, the merge will be unsuccessful.

I can create a single contiguous variance on an asymmetric chart,FPA34-5499,7514665,User Story,Open,FPA34,Medium,I866445,I819634,I819634,4/22/2020 16:29,7/16/2021 20:45,9/29/2022 9:59,,,,"BI (Charts, Explorer, Geo, Input controls, etc.)",,,,,,,"Customers have requested the ability to create a single contiguous variance that works across an asymmetric chart - the variance will only apply or show up on version / but not time, or time but specific to a version:

 !asymmetric_chart.png|thumbnail! 

Using a combination of Time + Version can work is possible, but it doesn't generate the comparison the expected by the customer where the variance can work across 'mixed' versions and 'pivot' such as FORECAST for Q1 2017 - ACTUAL for Q4 2016.

The attached document explains a workaround to do this in the product, however, there are limitations and consequences to it and also echoed by the customer:
* It's simply not possible to explain this to business / end-users who expect self-service ad-hoc reporting capabilities
* It seems the forecast layout with 'look back' on actuals, and 'look ahead' on forecast/budget is not ideal in SAC (asymmetrical as you call it). Why has this been introduced in tables if charts simply cannot follow this practice?
* It's a little bit visible in your own example that IBCS compliant display is not possible with this setup (show actuals in full black color, and budget in outlined with variance between them), making us wonder how SAC was IBCS certified for this part. When looking at the IBCS certification examples, we see often 'prior year' is used instead of 'prior period' which was not only more convenient, but probably the only way possible... which is striking.
If we have to set this up for each account... that's going to be a tedious job. It's not what customers expect at all from a simple SAAS solution.

The current options: import from a CDS view via OData, import from a CDS Query View or a BW BeX Query via JCo, import from the underlying HANA SQL View via SQL all have pitfalls today.

Here are more details on the Data Integration Challenges for the *SiemensFocuS/4* project as reported by [~D071936] :

*S/4HANA Live Connection*
 This is currently not an option for the FocuS4 Management Report because of
 * Missing data-cell based commenting functionality.
 * Severe performance issues with the underlying CDS data model that are part of a separate discussion between Siemens and the SAP S4/HANA development team.
 * Various BI functionality gaps between S/4HANA live connectivity and import data connectivity.

*Live Connection to the HANA DB under the S/4HANA system*
 It was decided in an early stage of the project not to pursue this further because of security concerns and a strong opposition by the S4 basis team. Moreover, even if we would decide to take this up again, we would face the following issues
 * Identification: All report users would need a HANA DB user with appropriate privileges
 * Reworking the data model: By simply wrapping the SQL view attached to the CDS view into a Calculation View, we would run into the same performance issues as before.
 * Hierarchies: Hierarchies have to be made accessible via Calculation View modeling.
 * Missing data-cell based commenting functionality.

*Import Data Connection*
 The main issue here is that because of the complex consolidation logic, we have to make a complete data reset at every upload. Moreover, the data upload is blown up roughly by the factor of 2 to emulate missing functionalities in SAC. In the end, we need to upload an amount of data starting from roughly 1,000,000 lines of data in fiscal period 1 and growing to roughly 15,000,000 lines of data to fiscal period 12 of the Siemens fiscal year. We considered the following options:

+BW Import Connection+
 This option has been ruled out because this connection does not support RFC/SNC, while this is a strict requirement from Siemens InfoSec.

+S/4HANA Import Connection (via OData)+
 This option has been ruled out because this connection type does only support OData services published in the SAP namespace and does not support OData services with parameters.

+HANA Import Connection (via SQL)+
 This option has been ruled out because this connection does not support SSL, while this is a strict requirement from Siemens InfoSec.

+Generic OData Service connection+
 This option has been pursued until recently and finally ruled out because of the following reasons
 * Simply publishing the underlying CDS views as OData services has been ruled out because of the long runtime of several minutes for the CDS query. We expect a connection timeout after 2 minutes. Instead, we plan to persist the data in a DSO in the embedded BW ??and expose the persisted data via an OData service.
 * Querying the relevant CDS views has a high system resource consumption that has an impact on the transactional processes running in the system. Therefore, it was proposed to divide the data upload into the DSO into several separate jobs to keep the resource consumption under control. This has a clear negative impact on maintainability.
 * An import job to SAC via the Generic OData Service connection is restricted to 800,000 lines of data. This would mean that we need to divide the data upload from the DSO to SAC into roughly 20 import jobs. It takes roughly 10 minutes to run 1 job uploading 800,000 lines of data. We identified issues with running the jobs in parallel, so we need to assume that the jobs are to be run sequentially, which will take 3 to 4 hours. With the necessary data quality checks and corrections of issues, the whole end-to-end process might take up to 1 day.
 * Maintenance of SAC import data jobs is insufficiently supported. The data mangler can only be accessed when creating the job. If we encounter data quality issues that need to be resolved, we might need to recreate all 20 import jobs. This is a time-consuming and error-prone process.
 * The overall architecture is overly complex and disproportionate to the achieved improvements.

+File Server Import connection+
 This is the only option that we have not yet ruled out. We will continue investigating it. The idea is to use UC4 or other tools to export the data from the S4 system to a file server. Siemens already has a SAC file server connection in place, used e.g. in the planning project. We identified the following challenges:
 * UC4 is maintained by a team outside of the FOCUS4 project. Latencies in the development process are to be expected. Preferably, we should rely on tools within the scope of the FOCUS4 development team. It needs to be clarified which tools are the most appropriate.
 * Firewall settings between the S4 system and the file server in the EAGLE data center.
 * Querying the relevant CDS views has a high system resource consumption that has an impact on the transactional processes running in the system. Therefore, it was proposed to divide the data upload into several separate jobs to keep the resource consumption under control. This has a clear negative impact on maintainability.
 * It is yet to be clarified whether we should store the data in a DSO in the embedded BW before exporting it to the file server.
 * The overall architecture is still complex and it will be hard to communicate to the FOCUS4 project leads that this is the to-be architecture.
 * All development resources in the FOCUS4 RA team are assigned with prio 0 to fixing severe issues with the S4 1909 update that scrambled the Siemens extensions of the S4 data model.

*Conclusion*
 * SAC is still unable to provide a convincing enterprise-ready data import mechanism for larger data volumes
 * Until a successful implementation of the File Server Import connection, Siemens will have to continue to rely on the current painful and highly manual data upload process: Download the data via AFO in several chunks, process the data in EXCEL, upload the data via file import to SAC.
 * Because of slow authorization processes in the FOCUS4 project team and lack of resources in the FOCUS4 RA team, a considerable delay in the solution of the issue can be expected.
 * There is at present no guarantee that we do not identify other restrictions when pursuing the implementation of the export to the File server. The main risk factors are performance, security constraints, limitations in the chosen export tools.

The Siemens FocuS4 stakeholders would appreciate some guidance from the SAC project management or of other SAP subject matter experts on how to deal with the described challenges.",2,1

The ability to open a URL from an email retrieved on a laptop/desktop when that URL was generated and emailed from a mobile device.  This should be transparent to the user and simply open the SAC story without any action other than clicking on the URL. 

What is the opportunity/problem the request will address?

Currently when an executive is emailed a URL from a colleague on a mobile device it is reasonable to think that the executive will open the URL on a laptop.  If he/she does so there is an error message.   URL's generated from mobile devices can currently only be opened on other mobile devices because they require the mobile app.

What is the expected benefit?

It would often be handy to hide visualizations when viewed on a phone.  For example, we may have graphics that appear on mobile ... and we still want to display them on mobile for an iPad ... but display on a phone may be problematic.

For example, we have ""next page"" / ""last page"" icons for navigating on the Surface Hub.
These icons have to be at the top of the page for various reasons.
They also take over several pages of visual space on the phone (only).
Love to be able to hide a visualization.  Even better, hiding a whole lane would be helpful (lanes could be displayed on phone, all mobile, all platforms).

In essence, the same ideas can more generally applied to story and page filters, as well.

Please note that the current behavior for multiple selection story and page filters is as follows: To filter for all items containing the string ""BOSCH"", you need to

# Deselect all selected items.
# Type in ""BOSCH"" into the search field.
# Select the ""Select all Results"" checkbox.
# Click outside of the filter dropdown window.

This is widely regarded as very unintuitve by the KAESER end users.

KAESER is looking for a form-like behavior of the filters where they can directly type the desired input for which the table is filtered.?? The search should allow to not only match the exact values, but also allow the parts of the values in between, e.g:

??Highlighting the matched strings while the user is typing would be an extra cool feature that the customer would fancy.

A solution we've though of is introducing free-text input in the table header. This is not a must, but just an idea. Also standalone filter widgets with free-text input might be an idea.

ID&A Usecase:

Example 1:

There are various usecases for regular review sessions (MBR & QBR) based on dashboards. In those cases meetings are often prepared and comments have to be stored to explain specific changes, outliers, trends etc. Currently we can't make use of the CommentWidget because most of out data sources have model variables (e.g. Currency, Snapshots, Regional restrictions etc.)

Example 2:
I have a live data model based on a hana view. Currently the CommentWidget does not support this model because my underlying hana view has different input controls (e.g. currency, period selection etc.). I would still like to make use of the commenting widgets for dashboards based on this data source.??

I can see three solution scenarios here, the last one should cover everything while the first two are probably easier to achieve but lack flexibility:
 # Simply ignore the prompt settings: means they are not considered or stored for the commenting widget but we are still able to use the widget. Currently we receive an error that ""Comments are not supported on models with variables"".??
 # Automatically store all prompt settings for underlying models and only show comments for the specific combination of prompts / filter values in the story
 # Allow the story builder to define which model variables are content relevant for the commenting widget. E.g. the currency shouldn't be considered because the context does not change based on the currency. On the other hand if you look at different snapshots or filter by a customer based on the model variable this might change the whole picture and would be a reason to show comments only for this specific selection. So i guess the best approach would be to provide a menu in connection with the commenting widget where it is mandatory to select which prompt values should be considered (in the same way as a dimension input control) and which should not.??",2,1

a customer had an??1908 OData services and built SAC models (from a query based on the 1908 OData data model) and stories on top of that. Now we release the 1911 OData services, and we added a field. For the customers to make use of this new field in their stories, do they need to rebuild it off the same query. Or do they need to create a new model (which would be a big issue because now they would need to change the reference to that model in all stories).

??

=> In a nutshell, what is the expected lifecycle handling of a model and stories dependent on the lifecycle of an OData service?

??

I have tried the following with a google drive import and i couldn't see the updated column??

on the models in SAC.??

Below is what we tried:??
 * Create an Excel spreadsheet with two columns and data
 * Build the model
 * Build the story
 * Now add another column and data to the spreadsheet
 * Select to rebuild the model
 * It does not show the new column

??

Kindly help with a suggestion.??

thanks,

 * What connections are being created?
 * Which customers are using which connection types?
 * Which personas are using which connection types?
 * If it is an import connection, how many refreshes have executed?

??
 * How often are these connections being used by end users in stories?????
 * How many stories/apps (artefacts) use this connection type?
 * How many times has this connection been opened in artefacts?
 * If model A is created from a live source, and model B is created from an import source, and a story is created with 2 charts using model A and 2 using model B; then we want to count 2 for A and 2 for B.

They will be scheduling multiple jobs to load master data and transaction data round the clock. They would be scheduling multiple jobs in multiple models and dimensions. It would be tough for the customer to go into every job and check the status if it ran successfully or not.??

Customer is complaining about Data Management UI not being user friendly. If multiple jobs are scheduled then they need to do lot of scrolling to check the each scheduled job status.??

Customer wants other than Admin and Modeler a small user group (first level of support) to monitor the jobs as well. They would like to have a central location to monitor the jobs like the way we have the in BW with RSMON transaction code. They would like to get some intimation on the scheduled jobs so that they can take the necessary action.??

Also customer is requesting to provide more details on the scheduled job. Right now we only see the failure and success messages?? but would like to see more description esp. when the jobs fails.?? They would want to see the description both for Import as well as export jobs. Right now for the export jobs we dont see status except in the notification area.??

*Business Reasons:*??

*With many jobs scheduled in multiple models it would be tough for customers to monitor them plus its quite time consuming and involves lot of scrolling to check the status. Non-admins are also expected to monitor the jobs. Customer doesnt want to give non-admin users to access the Model.*??

*It will become very tedious for customer to monitor every job by going into data management tab hence requesting a central Job monitoring location where all jobs can be monitored plus provide more detailed description and status of jobs (both import and export).*??

We would like to use within our stories a story filter allowing the end-user to have different versions of data and to switch between these versions. For the table, we can place the story filter somewhere within the table and then the table will follow the story filter. This means that the table respects/follows the story filter and updates its content depending on the version selected.
 
However, the charts, for example the two KPIs on the screen, have the problem that the story filter must be ?€?hard coded?€? within the chart controls. This must be hard coded at development time, which means that if the customer switches the story filter to a different version of the data, the chart control will still run against the ?€?hard coded?€? version, effectively against the wrong data version. This completely means that we can not activate the story filter for the end user.

Can you support us, with this feature request?

Based on the user roles,designer application should be intelligent enough to hide some content of the application for the user with Manager role, whereas his Manager should have access to complete content of the application.??

Ex:??

Let's take a case where analytical application is built having 3 charts & 2 tables widgets .??

User 1- (Role : Manager)

User 2 - (Role: Manager of Manager)
 * He/She should be granted access to all 3 charts and 2 tables in the application.

This is possible only if we have any API's to read the user roles of Manager/His Manager within SAC.??

Today, all that we have is only support for Application.getUserInfo API, which gives information of who's the user access the application. Additionally, we will also require supporting API's in fetching his/her roles. With this capability, we can leverage & implement single application accessible by multiple users with different roles/authorizations.

More background for the feature:

We have one main SAC story with OData model underlined. At the same time recently we introduced a new page/tab in this story which is working via live data connection. This page requires end user to have an extra subscription, which might be not the case for all end users.

Unfortunately the authentication popup appears right after customer loads the main story.??Closing or ignoring this pop up will also bring a misleading warning that connection to the system has been lost.

This behavior will not be accepted by our customers. That is why we would like to have an option to ask for credentials only when a page with live connection is opened.

in the context of the escalation at Severstal, I tried re-creating their story in an analytic application to design some content in a more efficient way. I ran into some limitations that I would like to raise here:

We can use Calculated Input Controls to dynamically filter certain objects in stories (Calculated Dimensions, Restricted Measures, ...).

We do not have the functionality of Calculated Input Controls in Analytic Applications and - as far as I can tell - no APIs to achieve similar scenarios.

One Example:
# Create two Calculated Input Controls: IC_1, IC_2.
# Create two Measure-based Calculated Dimensions: CD_1, CD_2.
# Set the Context Filters of the CDs: Set IC_1 as filter for CD_1 and IC_2 as filter for CD_2.
# Create a table widget using both CDs in the rows.

As far as I can tell, that's a scenario that is possible in stories but not possible with Analytic Applications.

So, it would be great to enhance the API to control filters for these objects.??

Thanks and best regards,

Christian

After the selection has been confirmed, the data set shown to the user will get updated.

*----------------------------------------------------------------------------*

*Story #1:*

As a casual user for the Exploration Mode in SAP Analytics Cloud, I want to be able to enter / change the variable and prompt values that are part of my data source (including BW Variables and HANA prompts and Universe Prompts). I want to be able to open the variable / prompt dialog (same dialog as in the story) and see any already configured variable / prompt values and have the ability to change those values and confirm the value selection.

After the selection has been confirmed, the data set shown to the user will get updated.

??

*Expected behavior:*
 * The dialog for the variables / prompts should be the same dialog as used for the story variables / prompts
 * In case the user configured filter values for a dimension facet, which are after changing the variable / prompt values not valid anymore, the dimension facet will show the data according to the variables.
 * Dimension that are used as part of Variables / Prompts and do have configured variable / prompt values should be included into the list of facets (similar like filter dimensions from a widget)
 * Variable values / prompt values entered should be shown as part of the Filter dialog for each dimension facet
 ** example:
 *** User is using BW Live with a variable for dimension country
 *** User is entering the values Germany and Canada for the variable for Country
 *** User is adding dimension Country from the resultset to the list of facet
 *** dimension Country is shown as a facet and the Filter icon is shown as well, to indicate that the list has been filtered down to Germany and Canada
 * Configured values for variables / prompts also should be part of any bookmarks

????

*Story #2:*

As casual user of a SAP Analytics Story based on a data source that also contains variable / prompts I entered the values for the variable / promtps as part of the SAP Analytics Cloud Story. I then navigate from a widget of the story to the Exploration Mode (or user is clicking on the ""Data"" option). When opening the Exploration Mode the system will ensure that the already entered variable / prompt values are also transferred to the Exploration Mode. When I then open the variable / prompt dialog, I will see my previous entered variable / prompt values.

??

??*Current Behavior:*
 * The actual prompts from HANA, BW, and Universes are already supported and working
 * The part that is missing is:
 ** adding the used dimensions into the list of facets
 ** adding the configured filter values as filter values to the facet with the filter icon being enabled

As casual user for the Exploration Mode in SAP Analytics Cloud I want to be able to define a Ranking for the dimension fact. The system provides with the option to sort dimension members in a ascending / descending way based on dimension member description or dimension member ID. In addition the system provides me with the option to sort and rank the member of the dimension facet based on the measure value. I have the ability to sort the dimension members in a ascending / descending way using the ""default measure"", which would mean that the dimension sort order will get adjusted each time a user is selecting a different measure in the measure facet.

Instead of using the ""default measure"", I can also specify a measure for the individual dimension facet.

In addition to the sorting option I can also define a ranking (Top N, Bottom N).

??

*Story #2:*

As Story Designer I can create a new view as part of the Exploration Mode and I can configure the sorting of the dimension member for each dimension facet that is part of my defined view. I have the option to define a sort order based on the default measure or I can preset a different measure. I can use a ascending or descending sort and I also have the ability to define a ranking (Top N, Bottom N).

??

*Expected behavior:*
 * The ability to sort and rank dimension members per facet should be a configuration that can be set as a default configuration for a specific view
 * The information on sorting / ranking for a dimension facet should also be saved as part of bookmarking

??

??

*Performance*:

This needs to be tested especially with large set of dimensions and dimension members as in such a scenario a change in the measure facet will mean that we have to do a new ranking potentially across all dimensions of the dataset.

!image-2020-08-31-17-51-32-575.png|width=279,height=68! ??

The link _Contact Admin_ would then disappear. As well as the discussion icon next to the help icon.

!image-2020-08-31-17-52-41-180.png|width=522,height=466!

Unfortunately they are using the Discussion functionality in some of the projects hence it cannot be disabled.

They already have used their own *Browse Community* link to jump to their community page and added the Simplex link there, however few users are still using the _Contact Admin_ discussion function and that is creating issues for them. The user must not get the option to contact Admin from SAC or the option should point to our Simplex link.

So my question before creating a new jira for this is, if we do have any out of the box solution for this?

Looking into our internal tenants and playing a bit with the roles I do see, that if I am an admin I do get a _Create Support User_ botton instead of the _Contact Admin_, which only appears for the roles Admin, BI Admin, or System Owner. This makes me think, that it could be maintainable in the roles but I can?€?t find anything related except the Discussion which fully removes all discussion options. So is this hard coded?

Give the Tenant owner an option in System Administration to turn on a radio button that says display tenant name.?? Then give the Tenant Owner a field where he can name the tenant something users will understand. This would then get displayed next to the user's profile picture.

The customer BNP Paribas Lease has developped a SAP Cloud Platform portal in which he is embedding SAC reports in iFrames. This portal is an??+*external*+??portal used by BNPP LS' customers.

The customer raised a concern as,??*when exporting the SAC data into Excel*, the Excel file has 2 tabs (see attachment):
 * The first tab contains the raw data
 * The second tab contains technical information regarding the request, and one of the information displayed is the URL of SAC.

This is causing a security concern to BNPP LS, as it means that their end users (who are not BNPP employees but are their customers) will be able to know the URL to access SAC, when BNPP LS only wants their customer to access to the application through the URL of the portal, and they don't want their customers to access directly to SAC.

The need is therefore to have a functionality allowing to designers of the story to specify that only the raw data tab should be exported into Excel.

Allow Navigation within Result Set via Input Controls / Page Filters,FPA34-5659,7731476,User Story,Open,FPA34,High,I866445,D049609,D049609,6/2/2020 8:59,11/21/2020 5:28,9/29/2022 9:59,,,,"BI (Charts, Explorer, Geo, Input controls, etc.)",,,,,,,"Customer Severstal is in global escalation. The customer has requested changes in SAC to achieve a better performance.

This request is a proposal for a different way of applying the different filter types.

Would you please review the following request and share your view?

At the moment, we have story filters and page filters directly affecting the queries that we send to SAC. Changing any of the filters will lead to new GetResponse requests being triggered to the SAC backend for every linked widget. The same applies to the Linked Analysis feature. That leads to bad performance for the customer because every query requires multiple seconds to be processed. The customer, however, would expect navigation steps within the story to be much faster.

*Request 1: Page Filters to select data from result set*

While it is considered normal, that the Story Filters affect the result set fetched from the backend, this is not true for the Page Filters. The customer expects the page filters to be a navigation inside the fetched result set. So, the widget would fetch data according to the story filters and the page filters are only used to display the results from the result set that match its filter criteria. This way the initial loading time would be longer, but the navigation inside the story would be faster.

*Request 2: Linked Analysis to select data from result set*

The same as in Request 1 should apply to Linked Analysis, i.e. if a Linked Analysis is defined, the story logic should identify the dependency and fetch the result set accordingly for the linked analysis to work instantly instead of re-fetching the new result set.

Feel free to reach out if the request is not clear or if you would like to discuss it.

SAC BW Live Connection

*Test Systems*: Internal BW4HANA system D2T. Internal SAC tenant:??[https://dev-i327424.ap1.projectorca.cloud/]

*Issue Summary*

The story filter, which is created on a BW query variable(process type: authorization), does not reflect the actual BW analysis authorization of the BW user. This happens under the circumstance of user saving the story and reopens it with another BW user.

*How to Reproduce*:

Used Query Description:

The query contains, besides the measures, only one Dimension, which is the??characteristic Z589LAND.

The query has one fixed filter for Z589LAND, which is processed by authorization.

Story Design:

The story contains only one page, on which is a simple table widget, where the query model is used. The story has a story filter, which is linked to the authorization variable?? created on Z589LAND.

This characteristic is authorization relevant.

There are two BW users needed to reproduce the issue:

The BW user XG_TEST1??is only authorized to view 3 values of the characteristic Z589LAND.
 * Afghanistan
 * Bahamas
 * Cambodia

Whereas the BW user GOUX is authorized to see all data.

??

??

*First,*??the user??XG_TEST1 creates the mentioned story(referred to as story 1), where he will see only 3 members of the dimension, which is correct. He also sees the story filter reflects the correct values.

*Second*, the SAC user saves the story (referred to as story 2)as a new one and logs out.

*Third*, another SAC user logs on to the tenant, opens the story 2 with another BW user, which is GOUX, who has authorization to all data.

??

At this point, GOUX is not seeing all the data he is allowed to see, but only the ones which was authorized for the previous user XG_TEST1 who saved the story.

At the story filter, also the filter values does not reflect GOUX's BW analysis authorization.

GOUX has to select the filter again to view all the data.

It means that the authorization variable does not get purged after the story is saved.

Please refer to Part 2 of the attached videos to see the issue.

??

*Expected Behavior*

The story filter, linked to query variable processed by authorization , should always be purged while opening the story.

??

*{color:#ff0000}Impacts for the customer:{color}*

As Samsung adopts SAC as a self service platform for hundreds of end users, and more than 10,000 queries. The story will be used heavily and end users will use the ""save as"" functions to create their own analysis. If the authorization variable is not displayed correctly, those end users will be puzzled and it would cost the customer, at such a scale, a lot of time to adjust the variables.

Ticket 19753 closed by SAP, enhancement request instead.
 

Please describe your improvement request

Last changed field should show when master data was last updated, and not only meta data changes.

 

The column ""Last Changed"" for models and public dimensions refers to meta-data changes of the respective entities. 

Usually, once a model or dimension are set up, the need to check on when meta-data has changed (Dimension preferences and the like) is not very high.

The need to check on when the master-data was last updated in the model/dimension is much higher, not to mention that it is generally the first thing a user thinks of when reading a ""Last changed on"" field.

 

What is the opportunity/problem the request will address?

Our users need to see when data has last been updated, to be able to know what information is being pulled from our datasources, or in some cases to know when a dimension which doesn't have a datasource was last updated.

 

What is the expected benefit?

Have a higher control and understanding on when the data was Last updated in Models/dimensions",1,1

When working with ERP data, some information in different columns is based on the same source.

In digital boardroom using navigation we need to identify which tile-jump offs are still working and which are not.

 
*Business Scenario / Example*

As a Digital Boardroom creator while maintaining Navigation from one page to another.
I want to be able to identify which navigation still work and exist without the need to enter presentation mode:
When maintaining a complex Digital Boardroom we regularly have the need to create navigation from specific tiles on pages to different pages. 
These Jump-Offs change over time and need to be deleted and reintroduced. 
At the moment it is not possible to identify which tile-jump offs are still working and which are not. 
It would be helpful if within the digital boardroom builder while maintaining tile jump-offs, 
those jump-offs that work from no longer existing tiles are marked as such. 
And those that lead to no longer existing pages / topics or to hidden pages are also clearly and easily identifiable.

Without this feature we require a lot of manual testing and going through all navigation in presentation mode to validate if all required jump offs still work.
To further simplify this it could be a good idea to directly show a warning on those pages with errors in navigation as soon as opening the navigation panel. 
Another idea to ease navigation overview would be to mark the path from a single navigation to the target page to make target discovery easier.

Workforce Analytics Connector not available when populating a dimension with data,FPA34-5630,7699820,User Story,Open,FPA34,Medium,I050494,I073794,I073794,5/27/2020 7:06,10/1/2020 17:23,9/29/2022 9:59,5/27/2020 7:06,,,Data Integration,,,,,,,"SAC has a connector to Successfactors Workforce Analytics (WFA). This connector can be used to populate a model. But the connector does not appear in the list of connectors when trying to populate a dimension.

??

The result of this limitation is that we cannot get the hierarchies from WFA via the Workforce Analytics connector.

??

The request in this Jira is to enable SAC to use the Workforce Analytics Connector to populate a dimension.??

??

+*Background information:*+

The API call to fet a list of all dimensions in WFA is this:
{quote}Dimenisons
{quote}
[https://analyticsdemo8-apimgmt.sapsf.com/odatav2/analytics/v1/Dimensions]

??

The API call to fetch all dimension members in a dimension (for example ""location"") is this:
{quote}DimensionsMeta('Location')/DimensionNodes
{quote}
[https://analyticsdemo8-apimgmt.sapsf.com/odatav2/analytics/v1/DimensionsMeta('Location')/DimensionNodes]??

??

You can actually validate that this API call works in SAC by creating an ""oData Services"" connector and entering the above freehand query. This will return a dataset with (among others) the 3 main properties:
 * Caption (description - for example: ""Paris"")
 * Path (ID - for example ""EuropeFranceParis"")
 * PArentPath (ParentID - for example ""EuropeFrance"")

However, this is not a viable long term solution that customers have to create two connections - one for populating dimensions and another for populating the model. Customers will expect that when there is a Workforce Analytics connector it can be leveraged to populate both the model and the dimension.??

(Standard) Variance to Support Dynamic Versions for Charts,FPA34-4858,6831723,User Story,Open,FPA34,High,I866445,I864747,I864747,11/19/2019 4:09,9/21/2020 13:15,9/29/2022 9:59,,,,"BI (Charts, Explorer, Geo, Input controls, etc.)",,,,,,,"As the planning team introduces the set up of dynamic versions, the version selection in the variance builder shall support this dynamic version.

When the dynamic version is selected then the end user sees which ever version is currently configured for this dynamic version.

A Bar/Column chart with the following definitions:

?? !image-2020-03-10-00-58-50-762.png|width=1078,height=475!

??

The user would like the variance to dynamically calculate based off of what Version is selected by them in the Page Filter. Creating a 'Restricted Measure' which was a combination of the Account in question and Version 1. I then thought that having Variances that looked at these dynamic Restricted Measures would do the trick, however, it kept showing a variance of 0.

What I've had to do now is the below:
 !image-2020-03-10-00-56-24-552.png!

??

Forcing a Version selection like above means it's no longer dynamic and two things has to happen:

1. I have to create a variance for every possible combination

2. The end user will have to hover over the chart and apply the correct variance combination (or even with skipping 1, do the same via a 'suggested comparison').

Given the fact that I can create a variance without having to define a Version/Time, there must be some way to respect the restricted measures in a more dynamic way.",1,1

Hi [@Patrick Melli|https://jam4.sapjam.com/profile/wall/0kCoFgD5Mv7EFzUXEFsTwK] , technically, the ERP driver is still on the older stack of SAC, and does not have the same behaviour as the other drivers.

Therefore, I am creating this user story to ask the Sort option to be hidden from the line chart?€?s menu options.

As a comparison, for the Rank function, it works, although it may fall into the same category as the Sort function that Rank breaks the time dimension.

Our product LaMa Cloud is embedding SAC. The concern is if we keep the Sort menu option, our customers may raise BCP incidents on our product as it does not appear to work.

However, as they work thru their Planning process they'd like to be able to make specific selections within Pages/Stories for Reporting/Comparative purposes (e.g. pick a prior year Actuals).

Currently the only global filter selection I can see is a 'Story Filter', but once a user selects those dimensions as their Story Filter, the individual page filters within SAC are overridden with the above selection.

Cascading Effect/Linked Analysis on either the Page Filters or Story Filters seem to provide no ability to override or make a specific widget (table/chart) to look at the page filters and override the story filters.

Also looked to see if we could create an input control of some kind on one page that would then connect to other pages for Planning purposes but could not find a method.

This is incredibly cumbersome for Planners to go into a Planning Story with multiple pages and have to re-select their Version (or other dimensions) repeatedly and which is much more prone to user error.

For a table in a story, user can export the table content as a CSV file or excel file.

But right now, it only exports the content for the cells in the table grid.

It would be better if additional information could also be exported at the same time, such as the selection for the related input control.

This because, when export data from table, user is very likely to do some additional processing in excel. And the additional information such as input control selection may also be needed in that process. And as an end user, normally they will not be able to export data from model directly.

Below see Screenshots of the Filter Line in e.g. Design Studio in S/4 compared to the filter tokens in SAC.

 To let the user style the filter token in a way that comes closer to the fiori style we need to enable the user to customize the icon. This could be a set of predefined icons containing the ones that are used in Fiori or letting the user select a custom icon.

??

Create a table on a story canvas and add a formula. Here we've used a sum: e.g. D5+D6.

Change the filter on the data - in this instance, changing to date reported to the next day, while removing the previously selected day.
The result is the formula editor display reverts to the text value (T) and calculation results in REF_ERROR

If we examine the formula now, the result is REF_ERR + REF_ERR.

You can, however, change it back to the previous day, and it again calculates correctly.

If we include both the original date and the new one, it calculates the formula D4+D5, skipping the values on the second date selected.


The SAP BOC Development Team explained that the formula processor uses not the fixed cell address, but the meta data (multidimensional tuple, set of dimensions+member) behind the cell. This is in order to allow the formula to calculate correctly even if the according data cell moves its position (e.g. when user drills down/up hierarchies or switches axes). Applying a filter can lead to filtering out or changing one of the dimension members. As a result the the multidimensional tuple behind the cell changes and the formula processor is not able to find the proper cell. This leads to a ""REF_ERROR""

Is it possible to enhance this with the solution proposed: to allow the user to set an anchor to a data cell address regardless of the metadata - to bring more flexibility when using formulas on data cells?",1,1

2.	Demo
3.	Training
4.	SAP S/4HANA Program

This will allow to have different system owners who could then maintain the tenants accordingly or would receive notifications accordingly for the tenants they are responsible for.

To achieve the above requirement, we need a means to maintain 
1. The relation between the Parent and the child OEMs
2. Based on the above information while the tenants are being provisioned for the child OEM, we should be able to maintain the parent OEM ID in the OEM list for that tenant.

Currently the user has the ability to configured Linked Dimensions - for example for HANA based models - and then leverage the blending in the charts or the table. As part of the configuration dialog for the Linked Dimensions, the user does not have the ability to configure which hierarchy should be the basis for the blending.

Because the user can not specify the hierarchy that should be the basis for the blending process, its not clear which hierarchy or if a hierarchy is being used as part of the blending process at all.

+*Suggested Behavior*+

As the user can use the data sources in several visualizations, it would limit the user when there would only be a single option to specify the hierarchy for the blending process. Therefore the blending should leverage the configuration from each widget and leverage the configuration of the linked dimensions based on the configuration for that specific widget.

Example:

Data Source 01:

Calendar Month Revenue
January 2018 5
February 2018 5
March 2018 5
April 2018 5
May 2018 5
June 2018 5
July 2018 5
August 2018 5
September 2018 5

Data Source 02

Calendar Month Forecast
January 2018 5
February 2018 5
March 2018 5
April 2018 5
May 2018 5
June 2018 5
July 2018 5
August 2018 5
September 2018 5
October 2018 5
November 2018 5
December 2018 5

In this example the user would then configure the blending on the two dimensions for the Calendar Month.
The user does not have the ability to configure a hierarchy or the flat presentation today as part of the Linked Dimension configuration.
Because it is time / date based dimensions, there is a default hierarchy and therefore the option to use ""All Data"" as Link Type is blocked which then leads to the situation that the user would never see the complete 12 months of data.

Required workflow:
 - User creates a new Story
 - User configured the Linked Dimension with the Calendar Month from both data sources.
 - User creates a new Table
 - User adds the Calendar Month from Data Source 1 to the Rows of the Table
 - User is opening the list of available hierarchies for the Calendar Month from Data Source 1 as part of Table 1
 - User is selecting the option ""Flat Presentation"".

>> This now means the Blending will use the Flat Presentation
 - User sets the Link Type to All Data.

>> Table shows 12 months of data.",1,1

*User Story ?€? Long Tail Analysis in Tables (Rank on Top N)*
 # As portfolio manager, I would like to rank my top N projects by Total Revenue, while displaying additional measures like Total Cost, Contribution and Margin in the same table. (Ranking already available)
 # I would like to see the totals of the measures for the top N projects, based on their standard aggregation. So Total Revenue, Total Cost and Contribution with SUM and Margin calculated as Contribution / Total Revenue (calculated key figure).
 # I would like see the total values of the overall values for the key figures with all filters applied on the table ?€? like I would not do the ranking, again with standard aggregation, margin as calculation.
 # I would like to see the share of the totals of the ranked projects to the totals of all projects.
 # Filter application: All filter, that impact the table, should be taken into account. So we would get the same results, if we would display all projects in the table, sort according to the total revenue, make a subtotal after the first (top) 10 and then take the existing total line and divide it by the subtotal.

??

*User Story Variation*
 # These functions should also be applicable for bottom N projects
 # This function might be only available for ranking on one dimension. If there is a solution for multiple dimensions, it should work accordingly and consider total and share for each dimension.

*Idea for an UI Integration:*??

If you select ?€?show totals?€? and if there is a ranking switched on, a dialogue should be offered to ?€?
 # Show ranked totals
 # Show overall totals
 # Show share of ranked totals to overall totals

Selection should be multiple-options. In the event, the ranking is switched off, the dialogue can be greyed out.

We are requesting an enhancement that will allow for this filtering. Ideally, adding cross-calculation as an option to the Advance Filter would be the preferred method of enhancement. Below, the partner has provided complete documentation on what our customer, WR Grace, is seeking.|
h1. ??
h1. Background

Cross calculations are used for a variety of situations. At the client, WR Grace, we are employing them to show the variance in Volume, Revenue, Cost, and Standard Margin between versions. We are restricted measure type cross calculations with input controls for the version so the end-user can quickly see different variances created by comparing different versions. At the present time and SAC version, we cannot filter on the cross calculation to show variances of real impact.
h1. Business Impact

The story that employees the cross calculation is widely viewed at WR Grace including no less than the CEO.?? Without being able to filter on these cross calculations, the length of the table is drastically too long for an Executive level report.
h1. Enhancement

The enhancement we are seeking could appear in either of two ways:
 # Add a selection to a page filter to allow for cross-calculations alongside Dimensions and Measures.
 # Add a selection to Advanced Filtering capabilities to allow for cross-calculations alongside Dimensions.

In either case, the user would have the ability to restrict the cross-calculation values by a static number(s) in the same manner that a measure input control behaves.
h1. Examples

In a table, we would want to be able to filter out all cross-calculation values between -$100,000 and +$100,000.?? I have highlighted in Red boxes the values that would be removed.?? As you can see from this random snip, almost ~25% of the report contains insignificant values for decision making.?? This enhancement would create better efficiencies in decision making and lead to more productive working sessions.
h1. Important Notes
 * In this particular use case, sorting cross calculations and filtering other dimensions (i.e. profit center or material) are not possible as the current format of the report is pivotal to the decision making process.

As a business user I want to be able to change the language of all story components, including filters.

??

*Current Limitation:*

A story is created with an Input Filter and a filter is set. These design steps happen e.g. in language EN (data connection language EN). Run the story, all looks fine. Then switch the language in the BW live connection to ""DE"" (German) and run the story in a new browser session (to ensure, you get a new session in BW).

Issue:

While the chart shows correct German texts, the input filter keeps showing English texts.

??

*Problem Statement*

The limitation was already captured within INC579510??[https://support.wdf.sap.corp/sap/support/message/002075129500005795102019]

??

The colleagues explained the behavior as following:
{quote}{{_The filter was created with specific values selected in the filter editor dialog. When that happens, the description of the dimension values (along with other info) used for building the filter are remembered and are used to construct the filter you see on the screen.?? This is what we call a static filter. When the story is reloaded, the set of info previously remembered is used to reconstruct the filter. ??This done because of performance consideration, as no further data or metadata retrieval from the database is necessary once the filter has been created initially._}}{{??}}

{{_To get the latest translated dimension values associated with the filter values, a query to the database will always need to be generated at the time the story is reopened.?? Each filter will need to generate 1 such query, and if the story has a lot of filters, there will be a lot of these queries being generated and processed, potentially slowing down the story loading process. ??Going back to the way static filter works, because no query is being sent to the server when the filter is reconstructed, it obviously will not get the translated dimension values.?? To get the translated dimension values though would requires us to change the existing static filter behavior and introduce performance regression._}}{{??}}

{{_Thus this is a feature enhancement because the static filter isn?€?t design to handle this scenario and we need to think about how to support translation with minimal performance impact._}}

As a modeler I want to be able to insert a dynamic text based on the topic filter that is used in the Digital Boardroom environment.

??

Business scenario:

In the Management Dashboard Scenario, we offer a topic filter based on the Profit Center Hierarchy, which is one of the main features used by our users. So far, what they filtered on can't be shown in the dashboard as e.g. a dynamic text field on the top. We already received feedback from several users, that this missing feature is needed.

??

Value added:

As well as with the option of dynamic text based on a story filter (picture 1), this would increase the usability and user experience of a Digital Boardroom a lot. Especially, for bigger dashboards, that contain a lot of content and therefore several stories.

This connector always return only the caption (label) for each dimension. This has a couple of unfortunate impacts:
 * If there are duplicate names the results are summed up. For example: if two locations are called the same name (e.g. Birmingham in US and in UK).
 * When mapping the dataset to a dimension records are rejected due to duplicate rows (again caused by two locations with same name).

The enhancement request in this ticket is to always return caption (label) AND path for each dimension. This will allow the user to map the dataset to the dimension properly in the wrangling step (mapping ""path"" to the ID and ""caption"" to the dimension description).

The reason we would like to have ""path"" returned is that we can use this to build up a hierarchy when populating a dimension. We cannot use the internal ID for this.??


*+Background information+*
SAC already has the caption and the path information today in the API calls it make to create the dataset it returns. The connector seems to work like this:

The main dataset contains the metrics requested + the dimenisons requested with the internal ID for each dimensions member. This internal ID is not a human readable value (example value: location_1_1_1_1). 




In order to convert this internal id to a human readable location name, SAC makes another API call to fetch all the dimension members in the dimension. The dataset for locations contains the internal ID, caption _and path_.


SAC then stitch these dataset together replacing the internal location ID (e.g. ""Location_1_1_1_1"") with the caption (e.g. ""Paris""). Now the location value is human readable. But... since this is a label it is not guaranteed to be unique, and therefore it cause issues.


Now, as you noticed the dataset with dimension members _already contains both caption and path_. So SAC already have both values available. Our ask is simply that you return both caption and path (2 columns) for each dimension requested.

 As a Dashboard Composer, I would like to be able to create a time series chart using max aggregations instead of average, so that e.g. CPU spikes can be correctly visualized.

*Business Scenario / Example*
 When creating a time series chart which has a lot of data points, SAC will automatically aggregate several data points into one. SAC will automatically visualize the average value of the measure for all aggregated data points. Only on hover, SAC will show also the min/max values. For some charts like CPU Utilization, this is not helpful. One is interested is seeing maximum values/CPU spikes. ""Averaging"" several data points will hide those spikes.
 Example Dashboard:
 [https://sap-modeling.eu10.sapanalytics.cloud/sap/fpa/ui/app.html#;view_id=story;storyId=9A24BAEEA862F10FF5B64875EB1E7D5A;forceOpenView=true]
 Chart: ""CPU Utilization Master""
 See also screenshot attached.

Having a measure definition which is using max-aggregation does not solve this btw. SAC will again visualize the average of several max-values.

*Value added if available*
 - Being able to visualize data in time series charts where one is interested in peak/max situations, e.g. CPU utilization.
 - This is blocking the transition of one of our SBEE dashboards to SAC

 * We are experiencing some data elimination by auto limit function in the trend chart with illogical elimination rule.
 The data placed on the right side of the chart are observed to be removed.??However, when we are using a trend chart, more important information tends to be placed on the right side than the left side since the chart usually contains current information on the right side.??
For example, a chart supposed to have the data until 2020-CW12. Due to the auto limit, the data between 2020-CW05 and 2020-CW12 are removed.
Since the latest trend is more important, we would like the data elimination to be done on the left side instead of done on the right side.
 * A part of data points with the same x-axis is shown while the other parts are removed.
 For example, a chart attached is showing a weekly trend of bugs by person in charge. The pink data point for?? 'Werner Thesing' is removed while other data points in the same week 2020-CW04.
 * The auto limit function removing the current data and even the partial data point for the displayed x-axis causes the confusion to dashboard viewers and causes a chart having critical loss of its data.

There is a need to have an API that returns back the metadata information on all the artifacts created in SAC for e.g. Stories, Analytical Applications and Digital Boardroom.

??

We've got an enhancement request from FedEx that we think it is also make sense for the product.??

Customer would like to audit their own usage of SAC for different stories/Dashboards among users.?? For instance, they would like to check??
 # Which users have been granted access to which stories??
 # How many users have been granted to access certain stories
 # Which story have been review most
 # No. of stories being used in last 6 month
 # last access date of certain stories.
 # .....??

We understand some information you could find in ""Activities"", but it has been organized in a very unstructured way, only table views, you could filter, but no count. For example, if i would like to know how many users have access certain story i need to count one by one or download as a CSV to count offline.????

Customers are looking for a more visualized way to review these information. They give us some example from Tableau i attached in this jira.??

My thinking is, if we dont have the plan to provide the similar auditing dashboards to customers, we could provide a workaround, such as scheduling export the current ""Activity Log"" to customers, then customers could use this as data source to regular import into SAC and making customized dashboards based on their own interests.??

Would like to hear your idea on this.??

best regards??

In the Variable Prompt Dialog, when working with the range selection for date (""From"" Date to ""To"" Date), the value of the ""From"" selection is automatically set to the ""To"" selection in case that the ""From"" date is greater than the ""To"" date. This might confuses the user and causes some additional clicks, if the selected ""From"" date was not meant o be the ""To"" date.??

Example:??

From Date: 01.11.2020?? ?? |?? ?? To Date: 01.12.2020

--> Both values of the date fields are automatically updated to:

From Date: 01.12.2020?? ??|?? ?? ??To Date: 01.11.2021

The automated correction is not wanted and not really beneficial, because in most of the cases the user have to change again the From date and the To date. Currently, the auto correction breaks the user workflow.??

+*Expectation:*+

If the user enters an invalid range selection for date, e.g. if the ""From"" date is greater than the ""To"" date, then the UI should throw an error message when clicking on ""Set"" and the UI should be blocked in the way that the prompt dialog cannot be successfully confirmed.

*Use Case:*

PepsiCo needs the account input control enhanced to better support their planning processes using a table.?? Key enhancements include streamlining the selection of accounts for the filter.?? Their account dimension has nearly 150k members with a parent-child hierarchy so selecting individual accounts for the filter does not make sense.?? Also, the flat display of the members makes it difficult to select values.?? They will also need to select multiple values from the hierarchy to make this work

They presented two use cases that will be detailed on a model that I have created.?? This has been provided as an attachment.?? PepsiCo is expecting this to be delivered as a page-story filter with longer-term enhancements that would make working with page/story filters more convenient for existing reports.

In addition to the account, they would need to have a multi-select on the measure as well for the Measure Input Control (MIC).?? This would make it easier to select measures for reporting.

?? ?? ??The bookmark / insight should always restore the last saved values for dynamic variable values (e.g. BW exit variable)

Today's Situation:
 * Customer use the exit variable
 * Customer does not select ?€?keep the last changed value?€? in design time
 * Customer run the application with the default value from exit variable, and later on change the value to another one
 * Customer save the bookmark
 * Customer opens the bookmark, then the bookmark still shown the default value from the custom exit variable rather than the last saved values.
 * This behavior applies in story, application and also data analyzer.

Workaround:
 * Customer can turn ON ""Keep last saved values for dynamic variables"" in the prompt variable dialog in application +design time+. This will let variable values persisted in application/bookmark are always used during query.??
 * No workaround available in Data Analyzer

Limitation in app / story:
 * If customer turns ON ""Keep last saved values for dynamic variables"" in application design time, the application runtime will use the variable value configured in design time as default value
 * But customer want to use the default value retrieved from BW backend (not configured in design time) when first time opening the application

Limitation in Data Analyzer:
 * ""Keep last saved values for dynamic variables"" is always turned OFF.??
 * The ability to customize this prompt setting is currently not supported as the setting is always hidden in runtime.????

Feedback provided by?? Redbull on 2021/10/19:
 * It is too complex for end user to make the decision about whether the last changed values of dynamic variables should be saved in bookmark or not. End user even don?€?t understand what is a dynamic variables

 * The desired behavior is that the story creator/app developer should be able to decide.
 * The application developer decides for ??this option (saving last changed values in bookmarks for dynamic variables) for the entire application instead of for each individual widgets
 * Script APIs about this behavior can be provided in analytic app. Application Developer can then trigger this behavior when it is necessary.",1,1

From [~D065916]
 * S/4HANA OData import connection can access CDS cube views (via SADL) or CDS query views (via embedded BW engine)

 * Analytical CDS queries, be they delivered by SAP or customer defined, are not meant to be used for replication. They even cannot be included in a custom communication scenario, even if they are annotated with @OData.publish:??true.
 * An OP customer of course can also use the full transaction SEGW to create an OData service. These services then can be included in a custom communication scenario.
 * BUT The S/4HANA OData Import connection has strong limitations (faced by other customers such as Siemens, etc?€?)
 * It doesn?€?t support CDS View parameters (aka it cannot be used against a CDS view requiring parameters), unfortunately many CDS view have mandatory input parameters
 * It doesn?€?t support accessing a namespace other than /sap/opu/odata/sap/
 * To overcome these limitations, the Generic OData Service import connection can be used, but it also has drawbacks:
 * Freehand oData queries are complex to create
 * For every CDS view, a new oData Connection needs to be created
 * The parameters must be fixed when defining the free-hand query, this makes the query very static

??

The limitation on the generic OData connection to a single query is significant.?? In order to have gerneric consumption of S/4, BW or DWC CDI views, we cneed a generic, single point of entry.????",1,1

So for e.g. if the intention is to reset the entire story to the starting points before any actions a user performed in a session such as setting or changing filter values then an icon other than 'Refresh' should be used.

There is also an complain that when connection breaks or there is an issue where the data is not loaded, the user has to basically refresh each and every chart in story.

When the user changes the volume the revenue changes that is the behavior we are looking for:

??

!RB2.png!

We can set the ""cell lock"" in the design time but if the user changes the layout (e.g. opening the month hierarchy) - the cell lock stays only at the intersection ""(all) & Trade Invest / SU"" as it was designed:

??

!RB3.png!

If the user now changes a volume (# Financial Sales) in one of the not locked columns the price changes in the changed column and even worst, the lock remains where it was set initially (price there is kept) and all other prices change to keep the locked price in synch:

!RB4.png!

The combination of having always all cells input ready & the cell locks might be confusing for the user.

??

please find here a more detailed explanation of the options we see how this can be solved:
 * Option I: we would need to be able to control the cell locking as well via an API in scripting:

The Value Lock Management Panel allows the user at design time to change the cell locks, it would be useful to have control over the cell locks via scripting.
 Then we could delete or create necessary cell locks when the drill-down changes:
?? ??

!RB6.png!
 * Option II: ~ not that important, we wanted to show here the issue with cell locks when a user navigates (from Year to Quarter or Month) but the cell lock stays on the level where it was set.
 ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? If we can control the cell locks via a script, the locks will be deleted on the aggregated level (All) by a script and re-set on the details (month/year level).
 * Option III: A BW-IP like approach where you can define per key figure in the query if a certain key figure is input ready or not. In SAC it looks that always everything is open for planning.

??And for DWC I have the following gaps from Marco:
 * DWC works at data base tables or views level, it doesn?€?t work fine with BW queries.
 * Today blending is used to complement data from BW query with local data. With DWC we would have to create dedicated view, reproducing BW queries, which is an option for specific cases but not for all

Usecase Fresenius-Kabi:

Combination of data which are in SAP BW with non SAP data which we integrate in DWC.

With this approach we want to user the power of DWC (unlock data) and combine it with data which we have already in BW and reporting is done via SAC

From the Security Point of view we aren?€?t happy to have an direct Connectivity between SAC World and the Direct Connection Data Source although there are only metadata collected and saved in SAC World, it doesn?€?t matter.

Our idea would be to use an additional SAP Web Dispatcher who would be the entry point for the Connection before the Direct Connection Data Source would be reached.

??

This is regarding linking dimension for DWC models across Workspaces.

As part of Data Plane Front Runner CFO and PLD (Practice Lead Dashboard)??proposal is to have 2 workspaces (*_SAP S/4HANA_* and *_SAP_MDI_*)

For applying common filters in SAC, we need to link the dimensions across models.

Currently linking of dimensions is allowed for the model in the same workspace only.

Across workspace linking is not supported.

Eg :

???????????????????????????? Let?€?s say

?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? Model SAP_S4H_ActlPlnItemSemTagCube (S4H workspace) need to be linked with SAP_MDI_WorkforceKPI (MDI workspace).

In the live data model the versions??Actual,??Budget,??Planning,??Forecast,??Rolling Forecast??have to be mapped to use the functionality of version-based variance chart. It results in a comparison of a measure restricted by version based on the report designers choice, for example, Sales Volume Actual compared with Sales Volume Planning.

Our customers plan in models that can contain many dimensions.??

Our customers prepare plan data offline in Excel and want to get the data into SAC as quickly as possible.??

In both cases (or in the combination of both), entering data via tables in stories or analytical apps, it is a lot of work to navigate through all the possible planning dimension combinations and enter / paste plan data.??

We should offer a way for end-users to have a safe way to upload clean and consistent plan data in a very short time.

*Need to remove the following obstacles and limitations*

Without this concept, customers may face end-user acceptance issues as end-users question why they need to go through a lengthy process to enter plan data or go through a technical interface to upload data. When using the model upload, customers may face issues with inconsistent plan data.??

*Scope*
 * Enable planning modelers to allow easy, safe and consistent data uploads via files like xlsx, csv, txt executed by end-users by creating an import template that defines the upload file structure and makes wrangling with its transformations etc. largely obsolete
 * Enable planning modelers to model multi-actions that contain file upload steps
 * Enable end-users to trigger uploads from a story widget or the SAC Home Screen via drag & drop
 * Enable end-users to preview the data, use basic wrangling features (to be discussed), import the data and validate results based on clear and meaningful success/error messages (e.g. ""Data could not be loaded because version ""Forecast is locked"")

Keep the asymmetric view in the table when advanced filter used in combination with unbooked mode,FPA34-6554,8904338,User Story,Considered,FPA34,Medium,I818705,I818705,I818705,1/4/2021 22:29,8/12/2022 21:24,9/29/2022 10:01,,,,"Planning (Allocations, VDT, etc.)",,,,,,,"Today, we have the issue when using advance filters in combination with unbooked mode on the filtered dimensions - that the table ends up showing all combinations and ends up with a symmetric view instead of the actual filter definition.?? ??Note that from a customer perspective this is considered a bug in that the resulting displayed query?? simply does not respect the explicit defined filter definition.

??

This is seen in the attache image, where the Advance Filter would include:

(Actual + 2019) or (Forecast + 2020)

??

Because the Forecast periods for 2020 do not continue booked values for the entirety of the year, the assumption is that to display or make available the FY 2020 requires enabling display of unbooked.?? In doing so, however the combination of Actual + 2020 and Forecast + 2019 appear.?? ??These are implicitly excluded based on specifics of the Advanced Filter selection.

??

*************************************

Per the related Influence Items:

??

When we use Advanced filter or Cross calculation??to define smart asymmetric structure (as Budget/lastYear, Actual/Q1 Current year and??Forecast 1/Current Year) which is a real life need, we have also to activate unbooked in order to see next period without data.

But when we activate unbooked feature for period, the solution show all the possible periods cross the version??or cross the restricted measure in cross calculations and somehow destroy or at least overcome those relevant features.

That means that unbooked feature is useless in combination with those very useful features. This is a nonsense !",1,1

 - Data Authorization is applied for Cost Center
 say User 1 has access to Cost Centers - CC11, CC12, CC13
 and User 2 has access to Cost Centers - CC21, CC22, CC23

current behavior
 - If report is saved by selecting CC11 then for both User 1 and User 2 filter selected will be CC11
 since User 2 don't have access to CC11, data will not be displayed nor it will be populated in filter values

 - Requirement when User 1 opens the SAC Story by default first available Cost Center need to be selected that is CC11 (for User1 Cost Centers- CC21, CC22, CC23 will not be populated since he don't have access)

What problem this will solve:
 SAP Analytics Cloud core planning includes features like ?€?Generating Private Versions?€? and ?€?Advanced Commenting?€?. To be able to use SAP Analytics Cloud core planning, data have to be imported into SAP Analytics Cloud Planning Models. SAP Analytics Cloud Planning Models can use global dimension importing data from different sources for e.g. in a hybrid scenario with SAP BW as source system it could be very useful to use existing InfoObjects as import source for SAP Analytics Cloud global dimensions and keep data in sync.

Further, customers have existing set up to load the data into source system and to further bring the data to SAC they would like to extend the existing process by making an API call to SAC to trigger the data upload, again as an example the BW process chains can be enhaced to make a API call to SAC to trigger already scheduled job to push the data into models.

??the data load could also be triggered when a certain condition is met.

Part of Bookmark enhancements FPA34-3860

Problem statement:

Story viewer wants to open the story with preserved view-time table actions from their previous session.

Proposed Solution:

Bookmark needs to capture the following table view-time actions:

Priority 1:
 * Sort, Rank (w/ Break Grouping)
 * Resizing of rows
 * selection of hierarchy per dimension
 * Hiding columns/rows
 * Show/hide total
 * selection of drill level

Priority 2:
 * Viewer created calculations
 * Display ID/Descriptions options
 * booked/unbooked
 * display of id/description
 * zero suppression

Priority 3:
 * freeze lines
 * swap axis
 * show hide: Grid, column & row headers, table title, subtitle, table details, reason for unplannable data, formulas, references, dimension headers, repetitive member names
 * fullscreen mode

Some of the workflows which?? should be useful is as follows:
 # Integrate?? SAP Analytics Cloud as a OEM app within MS Teams as an application so that business users who use MS teams can directly access the SAP Analytics Cloud dashboard without navigatingto the SAP Analytics Cloud over a browser.????
 # Provide share workflows between multiple different users for the SAP Analytics Cloud story and analytics applications including options like Scheduling publications
 # Integration as well include?? watchlist for quick-view of KPI's.

 # {color:#00875a}Share to different users?? within the Group channel when having the SAP Analytics Cloud Dashboard directly,?? it should be covering the automatic user mapping?? within channels with SAP Analytics Cloud + teams .{color}
 # {color:#00875a}SSO should work between users with what is configured within?? Teams?? and SAP Analytics Cloud for a seamless experience.{color}

Customer Reckitt (and others) have the following request.??

Simplified use case:??

Gross Sales = Volume x Prices where volumes are at the lowest level (prices at SKU on customer # but with a lookup also at lowest level) > this is no issue : I have a Gross sales account which multiplies at lowest level volumes and prices (so using exception aggregation for calculation at lowest level). This rolls-up well.. and also the inverse formulas (""Volume = Gross sales / Prices and Prices : Gross sales / Volume"") work fine when changing at the lowest level of granularity (SKU/Customer).

But the requirement is that they want to increase the gross sales e.g.?? by 1 Million on a higher level (for example a node in the product and customer hierarchy) and not of course at the lowest level. This is currently not possible: the cells are not available for input/planning with a message (limitation.. due to exception aggregation). So the system should first disaggregate the gross sales to the lowest level. (as it's doing when there are is no formula) and then execute the inverse formula on the lowest level of granularity (as you can do manually).

Kind regards,

Overall goals is to support operation at large scale, increase adoption and lower TCO

*The definition of ?€?large scale?€? within the scope of this discussion is for deployments of over 10000 BI users and 100?€?s of planning users. Beyond a simple single departmental deployment and typically multiple LOB or departments with multiple projects within them. Hence the number of users and the complexity of the tasks associated with organising and managing the content and planning and BI workflows will be high. Overall the number of content items will exceed 100k items.

*What problem will this solve?*
 * Allow customers to deploy at scale with low cost of ownership.

The goal of this initiative is to start small and develop a framework that can be used for additional checks by the modeler that can guide them towards a better design.?? While there are a lot of factors that could be considered for a model check, we are choosing to focus on version size and the planning area.?? It is our expectation that this framework could be extended with additional checks as the relevant rules may evolve over time based on our solution enhancements and customer scenarios.?? What needs to be determined is how best to surface the results of the checks for the end user.?? To date, the current proposed checks are as follows:??

1)?? Check if public and/or private versions exceed 5m records without planning area being configured

2)?? Check if DAC or DATA Locking is configured, suggest the modeler should configure the planning area.?? Could take rule 1 into considerations as well.

3). Check the number of private and implicit public versions that exceed 5m records and provide warning information as large editable versions may be problematic.

4) Check that version size is not greater than 50m records. (Not a hard limit, but larger versions generally result in more systematic performance issues in terms of data actions and story performance.

??

This check should be performed in the model vs. the story and should generate warnings as we are not checking against a real limitation.?? There is some flexibility in the rules and thresholds as the most important thing is to work out how to raise these checks to the modeler.?? Based on our ongoing escalations, we would expect new rules to be created that could be easily added to the framework we are developing.",1,1

After creating an acquired data connection to a BW query and saving it, there is no way to edit the mapping without redoing the entire thing.?? We often have requests from users to add one more field to a query or to change something very slightly.?? This becomes a large chore if the mapping already created was complex, and now has to be recreated from scratch.??

From Crompton Greaves:

The customer has a big number of large queries with more than 40 dimensions, sometimes even 80 and more. The remapping for all changed queries takes a significant time. According to the customer, they have to do the manual operation every week and spend hours on remapping fields. Retaining relationship by creating a new import query is highly demanded.

Idea is to perform Smart predict ??only on high level such as store then use planning engine to deallocation ??other dimensions in detail level based on last year distribution(to avoid unassigned assignment for other dimensions). ??Ideally end user only needs to select once and both engine can work together to make forecast more reasonable.

Wish list:
 # If dimension is selected in below window, then unselect dimension will be used as input as deallocation process in planning engine afterwards. The time window will be forecast year and previous year.

*Additional discussion notes*:
 From meeting on Apr 28:
 * Scenario: 2 dimensions, one with values A, B, C, the other with values B, C, D. The 2 dimensions are now linked with the linked dimension dialog. Now when we create a filter on the dimension, then we may have values A, B, C, D if we are doing union join, B, C if we do inner join, and some other variations if we have left outer (depends on which dimension we use to build up the filter; need to follow the existing blending behavior). This is the view time.
 * What about the member selector/design time? Does it have to also show values from both dimension? Most likely we need to also display the linked dimension values in design time.
 * May need to wait for the filter refactoring to be done first before we can attempt doing this feature.

From FPA16 meeting on Apr 29:
 * May want to do the linking at the model layer, thus the list of values for any specific dimension can come straight from the model and there is not much client side processing/logic needed.
 * Should loop this requirement into the input control/filter refactoring as the current filter model isn't able to accommodate this feature at present.",1,1

Within SAC there is a logic to compare two Measures A & Measure B. However, customers expect that the current comparison threshold should be a direct ratio or variance depending on the circumstances. For example, they want to compare Measure A to Measure B and set the following conditions:
* If Measure A > Measure B, then color Measure A green
* If Measure A = Measure B, then color Measure B yellow
* If Measure A < Measure B, then color Measure A red

*Proposed Behavior*
We need to introduce an additional threshold option to provide users an option to have a ratio comparison between two measures. For example, color Measure A depending on its value in comparison to Measure B.

*Workaround*
The workaround focuses on create a calculation to determine whether or not Measure A is greater than Measure B.

[Prompting] Clear/purge/delete prompt values/answers previously provided,FPA34-7093,10223079,Backlog Item,Open,FPA34,Medium,I866445,I049477,I049477,7/28/2021 14:46,6/22/2022 10:24,9/29/2022 10:01,,,,"BI (Charts, Explorer, Geo, Input controls, etc.)",BW Integration,,,,,,"Today, when providing answers to mandatory prompts in BW (or even optional prompts) the last answers provided are retained and its not possible to 'clear/purge or delete' these values previously provided. This is expect behaviour.

However, this behaviour is problematic in a production environment that enjoys a good life-cycle management and when users are some how segregated.

The problem is that when the story is developed in 'development', the prompts answers are provided and of course remembered even when the story is transported to production. It means that when you open the story in production is shows the last prompt values provided, which are the ones entered in development. 

This is a problem. because the value used in development might be for say 'Belgium', but the story is being opened by a set of users from 'Croatia', it means the users in Croatia have to keep changing the default value. It makes it really annoying because the dynamic default values are also not respected.

This means, that the business problem could be resolved by this JIRA ER, or (on some occasions, but not all) by another JIRA where by the default dynamic values are respected (except for time based objects as per JIRA https://sapjira.wdf.sap.corp/browse/FPA34-2869), however its highly likely this JIRA will be needed in its entirety and especially when non-default dynamic variables are used.

There is a workaround, but its a little poor:

The workaround is to change the mandatory prompts to optional ones, then run the story removing all prompt values. Save the story. Then change the optional prompts back to mandatory. This workaround, apart from the obvious downsides, also has a number of limitations when queries are merged together. Its seems very problematic in such cases as two prompt screens are then shown. (its unclear if the two prompts screen issue is resolved once the prompts are set back to mandatory or not).

A bit more:
The feature was provided in SAP BusinessObjects BI Platform Web Intelligence and customers are expecting this to be present in SAC.

What is this request:
The request is to provide a means by which a story developer can clear/purge/delete prompt values/answers previously provided, even for mandatory prompts as much as optional prompts. The story developer should then be able to save the story with the previous prompt values having been removed.

Google announced on Jan 14, 2020 that they plan to phase out third-party cookie support in the Chrome browser in two years. See details here: [https://blog.chromium.org/2020/01/building-more-private-web-path-towards.html|https://blog.chromium.org/2020/01/building-more-private-web-path-towards.html].

SAC's Direct live connections are dependent on third-party cookies, i.e. the cookies issued by the data source systems, including HANA, S4/BW, BPC and BIP. Without the browser support for third-party cookies, all SAC Direct live connections will fail, which will cause major impact for the entire SAC customer base.

Unlike the previous [SameSite cookie issue|https://www.sapanalytics.cloud/direct-live-connections-in-sap-analytics-cloud-and-samesite-cookies/], there doesn't seem to be a straightforward solution for this problem, as it requires a fundamental architectural change to SAC's live data connectivity.

In detail, this means that the first persona writes the total value to the top node, with all leaves and nodes below being empty. The second persona goes in and allocates this value for the next level, for his/her specific area.
We resolved this by adding dummy-leaves for each hierarchy level where we can write these values to. These were then added in property colums (h0 parent, h1 parent, h2 parent, etc.) with??_manual_ work. However, not even those properties can be used as parameters to filter the data action.

it would be great to be able to pass any free style selections regarding the Planning.setUserInput() api for planning. As long the the data point for the value is uniquely defined this should allow you to update or book a new value with a new combination. (Similar to Addnewrow in the story).

Right now the (ugly) workaround is to use a hidden table, which needs to be filtered first to the needed selection and then call setUserInput().

Would also be great to enhance the error messaging for the setUserInput() to be able to find out which dimension value etc. causes the error. Right now the error message is quite generic and does not help to easily spot the error and understand what has gone wrong.

we are currently looking into the data locking Api to be used for our upcoming Sales planning content, in which we would for example lock a reference version displayed in the locking table. So the customer has one Plan version column in which he can plan and one read only reference column to compare against, the latter one being locked.

However the behavior of the locking API is not clear to us.

In the example provided, you can choose a fiscal period to be locked.

??

!image-2021-10-14-08-42-54-071.png!

If you check the selection behind the ""Blocki Selected Period"" button, you can see that this is defining a dedicated cell to be locked, but it does lock *the whole column* (which goes into the direction of what we would want generally)??

!image-2021-10-14-08-44-36-311.png!

??

If I make the selection less granular, i.e. leaving out the ProductCategory I get an error message that ""the Data cell is not found""

!image-2021-10-14-08-48-03-577.png!

??

In the end I would expect the selection for our purpose being, the measure, the time and the version like this

??

var myLockingSelection3 = {var myLockingSelection3 = {

'@MeasureDimension': 'Price',

'Date' : lockingPeriod,

'Version': 'public.ReferenceVersion'

}

??

Is my understanding correct here or am I overlooking something?

The customer created a table with the calendar year in the columns using a dynamic time filter to restrict 2 years depending on a reference year selection. Default reference year is 2021 so we show 2020 and 2021.
Then they added a calculated column to calculate the difference between the two years. In the formula bar it is C1-B1.
The calculation works and shows the calculated difference column correctly.
If they now change the reference year e.g. to 2020 the difference column is not visible anymore.
It seems that the calculation C1-B1 does not reference the columns but instead referencing the years 2021 and 2020. So it is fixed to the 2 years the calculation was created for.
The formula states C1-B1 and not 2021 - 2020. After changing the reference year the column C1 is 2020 and B1 is 2019. So the calculations should still work.

It is important to have the table calculations being dynamic and independent of the members to provide variances in tables. SAC does not has a variance option for tables which leaves 2 options for calculating variances.

Option 1: Restricted and calculated measures
Option 2: table calculations

In this case Option 1 does not work as we have multiple measures in the rows and in the columns the years and we want the variance of each measure for the years.

Cross Copy Data action

If the source Model has some unbooked data and if we are copying data from one account member to a different account member in target model i.e.

Copying Volume data for all customers and all products from Source Model (some customers and Products doesnt have data i.e. have unbooked cells) to Target Model (where Target model has some booked data for some Customers and Product) then all the data gets replaced with zeros because source Model doesnt have the data for some customers and Products. Seems like Cross Data Copy is taking into consideration the unbooked cells as well. Is their a way to ignore the unbooked cells and just copy the cells with values ? Just like in the scripting we have the option to turn off or turn on the unbooked data option so can we have something for cross copy data action as well ???

This in turn would mean, as an example, a connection object would be visible, or not, by different users depending upon which teams they are members of.
# As the connection objects would have the same security access right settings applied to them (like today for public folders) this would then allow a Team of Administrators to manage both connection objects and connection folders. It would allow them to centrally edit and manage connections and grant/deny other users access. 
# For the connection objects to inherit security access rights in the same way that public folders do today
# For both live and acquired connection types are managed in the same consistent manner. There would be no difference, from an administration perspective, between these two different connection types.
# For live connection types to be create-able and editable by any authorised user even when they don't have access to the database including when SAML SSO is set. i.e. an administrator could set the server details, set SAML SSO and save the connection, even when they themselves don't have access to the database.



I use the term 'connection object' to mean a 'connection' definition.

If implemented, it would resolve the current problems of today:
# Connection chaos! Today there are loads of connections to the same thing, as there?€?s no overview of what existing connections are available or who has access to them, and indeed even if they did, they?€?d not be able to then ?€?re-share?€? the connection on. Connections to the same database are re-created as either users don't have access to the existing one, or they can't gain access because the connection owner isn't available
# only certain connections can be shared and those connections can only be shared by the person who created them, meaning that if that person is on leave no one else can grant access and you're back to the chaos! This JIRA would remove this problem as any user permitted 'share' or 'edit' rights could then grant other users/teams access. It would be better if they did this on the folder/sub-folder level to ease administration
# The life-cycle management issue when transporting a live-model/live-connection from source to target and that the administrator needs access to BOTH source AND target in order to change the connection. Today in many enterprise deployments, no such person has access to Dev and Prod. It means for these organisations they have to do an extra 'hop' via another server. (so step1: in DEV, change connection from dev to qa. step2: transport from DEV to QA. step3: change connection from QA to Prod. Step 4: transport from QA to PROD.)
# Admins are prevented from setting up the central 'live SAML SSO' connections as they don't necessarily have access to the back-end database 
# This enhancement may reduce the urgency need to have 'connection mappings' implemented as part of the Transport/LCM topic.",1,1

2/ If I use a table with all dimensions, when i add a new member I have to repopulate all dimensions one by one which isn't user friendly and cumbersome and not relevant in this use case, plus you cannot copy/paste the master data from one row to another??

Could we enhance the Add member feature? Here several options:

a/create an option to duplicate on a new row all source master data and let the end user only??modify the master data he wants?

b/ create an option that would keep the other master data of the other dimensions unchanged referring to a version and a date (more elaborated scenario based on versioning).

If the story consumer enters explore mode to analyze additional measures he needs to wait for the table loading in the explore mode for the initial view and then he adds a new measure and the table is loaded again.

As the table has been already loaded when the story consumer opens the page the ideal scenario would be that the table in explore mode is not loaded again if it has the same layout as the table the explore mode was entered from.

In the Plan table in the S/4HANA system (ACDOCP) there is a field called User Name (ACDOCP-USNAM). When doing the writeback from the SAC plan model back into ACDOCP it is the technical user copying the data that is stored in the ACDOCP table. It would be much better if the user that saved the plan value (that is stored in the Audit of the plan model) would be mapped to the User field in ACDOCP. What is the opportunity/problem the request will address? Our compliance team do not approve saving data into S/4HANA without a link to who created the record. What is the expected benefit? If the SAC planning user was saved in ACDOCP-USNAM it would be possible to trace who created what records and we would stay within the boundaries of compliance.

Complex scenarios with date and based on coding, other table/models beside the manual dimension and attribute/property definition are another major requirement.??

??

*Use-case:*

Having validation rules defined I would expect having the result set of the table deriving the right combinations instead of showing booked or unbooked (too performance expensive) only.??

In many cases the time dimension should be made available to define valid combinations to plan for and ideally as date property.

It should be made easier to define valid periods to plan for or make ready for input. Past periods should be locked (whereas this is in all cases the system date previous periods, but can be)??

There should be an option to define this centrally in time variables used in validation rules to avoid high manual effort.

The unbooked data option is then automatically activated for the other dimension (in the color section) as well.
 And customer needs to activate it only for Calendar Month, which is at the moment not possible.

?? !Table with same structure works.png!

The requirement is to display all months, even if there is no booked data on them. This is needed for Stacked Bar charts, the Calendar month is in the dimension section and for the color other dimensions are used. With the unbooked data feature it is only possible to select all dimensions from the chart, but we only need it for Calendar Month. Because otherwise the legend will show all the unbooked dimension values in the legend. At the moment it is already possible to activate the
 Unbooked data feature only for the dimension, which is used in the color section, but it is not possible for the dimension in the dimension section.

I presented BOC to them and showcased the visualizations, planning, predictive and data connectivity capabilities the product offers today. While they like the visualization/exploraration capabilities of the product, they are pretty set on their data access approach. Key requirements that came up during that meeting for Monsanto to consider using BOC are:

1) Live Connections to variety of SQL data sources (Oracle, Exadata, SQL, Teradata, PostGres, MySqL). The data sources are dispersed and while many data sources are on premise, they have a significant number of data sources hosted on AWS. Monsanto has large databases and they are not interested in replicating data for various reasons(having to re-build autorizations etc.) and would like BOC to access those source in a Live fashion ?€? like what we do with HANA today. I discussed the offerings that APOS provides and have some follow items to take back to the partner. The current capability of the partner solution is also limited because it only works with SQL Server and Analysis services. We will need to understand their roadmap to support connectivity to the data sources mentioned above, with and without going through the universe layer. I see online SQL access is on our roadmap as well. Do we have any concrete plans on this topic? We will need to look beyond just providing this access through the universe layer as Monsanto is looking to move away from their on-premise BI4 system.

The elaboration is still in progress - [~I514333] is working with UX on the mockups.

Requirement:

This is an issue that comes up frequently.?? It seems that the following reason for SQL Live comes up over and over: very large databases.?? Very often, the customer starts off by complaining about the 800k row limit.?? When asked about their result set size, they mention that it is in the millions.?? E.g. Bosch tables are routinely in the 9-12 million row range.?? Increasing the size of the 800k safety belt is really only a workaround for the real problem: we can't query the data where it resides.????

??

*Importance:*

Bosch -?? Access is important.?? They can live with slower performance (their SQL queries can run for up to 5 minutes)

??

*Customer Stories:*

*+ThyssenKrup+*

Thyssenkrupp require all data reported in SAC to be via a live connection. This will have to be meet in order to get sign off fro their work council.

SCIM API POST /Users (create user) should return 409 not 201 when email does not match existing userName,FPA34-7264,11040189,User Story,Open,FPA34,Medium,I055049,I049477,I049477,11/29/2021 17:14,11/29/2021 17:17,9/29/2022 10:01,,,,Developer/APIs,,,,,,,"Today, when 

1) SAP Analytics Cloud Authentication method is the default AND
2) A SCIM API /Users POST request is made, where the userName matches an existing user, but the email does NOT match that same existing user

then:
A new user is created! The userName allocated will typically have a _1 added to the end

Example existing user:
userid: MATTHEW email:matthew@sap.com

Make a POST request to /Users with requestBody userName=MATTHEW and email=matthew.shaw@sap.com
this will result in a 201 with a requestBody containing userName=MATTHEW_1
And thus we will have 2 users:

userid: MATTHEW email:matthew@sap.com
userid: MATTHEW_1 email:matthew.shaw@sap.com

The problem with this are mutliple:
* we have more than 1 user! We have a ""duplicated user""
* The requestBody (containing the userName MATTHEW_1) isn't a userName that we wanted. Worse still, is that about every 3000 to 5000 users this POST /Users will result in a HTTP 500. When this happens the user will still be created. But what's terrible is we have no idea what the new userName that was created is. Then, if you try to repeat your call (that previously returned a HTTP 500). you'll get a 409 conflict. But the conflict is not with the userName you think! The conflict will be with the userName you don't know the value of. So you then have to perform a GET of the user -but look, you'll get back the user MATTHEW, not MATTHEW_1. So you could try to update MATTHEW with the new email, but you'll then get a HTTP 400 because the email matthew.shaw@sap.com is already in use by another user MATTHEW_1.  It all gets very messy!

So this ER is for the POST /Users to NEVER create a user if when email does NOT match the email of the requestBody  (matching on the userName)

Today, the  POST /Users will NOT create a user only when the email does match the email of the requestBody (matching on the userName)

Today we can recognize geo dimensions when searching using S2I NLQ. For example a search for 'Sales revenue by State' will return a bar chart showing a breakdown of sales revenue by state.??

Although technically correct it is difficult using a bar chart for users to see if there are any geographic patterns in this as the results aren't mapped to physical space

Instead when a user searches and matches on a known entity of a geo dimension the system should return the results as a heat map on a choropleth chart so that info workers can more easily see if any patterns exists.??

 In the case where a user is searching for the breakdown of a measure by a (single) geo dimension the system should instead??show the results on a chorolpeth chart by default with the color of the state derived by the value of that state.??

Doing this will 
 1) improve readability of search results by helping users better see the patterns that may exist across states

2) provide better support for searching of models where there is higher cardinality at a given geo level (eg when you have more than 10 countries, states, counties shown). This is because geo map can map more dimensions at once compared to bar chart

3) will provide a new chart type supported in S2I(

4) will help demo S2I (everyone loves Geo maps).??

*Background & problem to solve:*?? To ensure business users can??always search & find the latest and greatest data it is critical that the S2I index stays in sync with any changes to the data or master data coming from Live (BW, LUC, S/4, DWC etc) models it is indexing. This is particularly important when new dimension members are added or changed as an example.??

However with S2I today there is no automated way of keeping the S2I index & Live model in sync. Today the S2I??admin has to be made aware that the underlying data in the live system has changed and then has to logon & manually re-index S2I to pick up the latest changes. SAC doesn't support the ability to schedule a refresh of the index because it can't impersonate the S2I admin without having them logged on. This approach doesn't scale as it adds to the workload of the S2I admin.

Solving this problem through automation helps unblock S2I rollout on live models which will in-turn help SAC further lock-in the SAP customer base.

In addition to the above a very related key problem for administrators have is understanding which models are currently being indexed by S2I. The only way you can tell what models being indexed is to manually open up each model and view model preferences to see if S2I is enabled.?? That or see the mode appear in the search result (which at that point is too late the model is already in production).??

*Goal for this epic*
 With the above said the goals for this epic are to;??
 * *Allow S2I admins to view a single list of all models that are being indexed by S2I -* including models based on live and acquired??data so that they have a clear understanding of what is searchable by S2I.?? From this list Admins should be able to see the model that is indexed, create a schedule, see a count of dimensions included in the index and toggle indexing on/off (more tbc).??

 * *Allow S2I admins to schedule a refresh of the S2I index against live sources??[daily?, hourly?]*????- so that the latest changes to the underlying data (eg new dimension members) are automatically included in the index. In terms of refresh frequency I would say once a day is a minimum. Ideally it could be as frequently as hourly.??

 * *Support impersonation when re-indexing??so we get all changes*??- We need to ensure that when the schedule runs it is done impersonating the S2I admin so that we get all the changes to the data. Just calling this out as its a problem

 * *Support all live models that S2I can index* - including BW, Hana, S/4, LUC etc

Note: Saeed mentioned this epic should consider using the Live Connectivity Service.

Performance is 50% of the Ux when it comes down to delivering a satisfying search experience. In particular the performance and interactivity as the user interacts with the type ahead suggestions when forming their question is particularity important. The faster that a user can use the type ahead suggestions to narrow down their question the faster they will get to an answer.??

To do this for S2I must have highly performant / scalable access to the S2I index as well as??suggestion services.??

To solve this a POC has been completed that has S2I running Kubernetes to provide not only a performant search experience (suggestions come very quickly) but one that also scales?? as the size of the index increases and/or the number of users on it increases.?? The KT of this POC has been transitioned over to Ron. Satish is also aware of it.??

The steps they followed are:
 # Adding a data source to my R widget
 # Adding the dimensions they need
 # Adding the measures they need
 # Adding the common filter they need
 # Trying to add a Dynamic filter on the current month (it?€?s just an example, it could be the x last months)


 # Overserve that the dynamic time filter has not been taken into consideration when re-entering the definition of my data source.

Ability to Use Cross Calculations for Blended / Linked Models,FPA34-6268,8504204,User Story,Open,FPA34,High,I051547,I864747,I864747,10/20/2020 13:25,11/22/2021 15:03,9/29/2022 10:01,10/20/2020 13:25,,,"BI (Charts, Explorer, Geo, Input controls, etc.)",,,,,,,"*Problem Statement*
 Users need the ability to create cross calculations within SAC charts/tables that reference two data sources (blended/linked models). For both acquired and live data sources.

??

*Use Cases*
1. Currently because Currency is seen as a cross calculation if we want to run reporting on local currency or default currency we cannot do this for blended models (because cross calculations are inaccessible). This is a major issue for running any form of reporting requiring currency conversion.

2. There are many use cases needed to create a restricted measure (where an account formula, table calculation and etc. will not suffice). For example, we have examples where a customer would like an end user to run comparative and variance reporting against user defined selections for Time/Version. This is a very common use case, see example below:

a) A user will select Time/Version via input controls (1) to define the restricted measure defined as 'Base' below (2)
!image-2020-10-21-17-15-27-338.png!

b)??**??This cross calculation is required and is defined as shown below, (1) are the user input controls and (3) again re-introduces the concern around needing to define different currencies.

!image-2020-10-21-17-18-54-231.png!

*Current State*
 Cross Calculations are not supported in this scenario and it is an extreme limitation that prevents appropriate usage of blended models and keeps single data sources and blended data sources for SAC tables/chart far from feature parity. If you see the attached screenshot, (2) is where the cross calculation is grey not allowing for any user selections/entries.

We can do this with Restricted Measures, however, we have limitations especially when we need drill capability in the Date dimension. 

!image-2020-11-10-15-53-27-675.png!

The above option allows for user selection to pick a date, however, does not allow for drill-down capability in the Story for the Time/Date hierarchy. Therefore we need to use the 'Time Navigation option. Therefore what we need is an enhancement to the current 'Time Navigation' option within Restricted measures as follows:

1. The ability for the year of reference for the previous option to be based off of a user selection (either a story filter, page filter, advanced filter, calculation input control or etc.). This could also be based off of a user-defined date range for the Story (as we can already do with the offset functions for Time in the restricted measure). Currently the Navigation option only supports system date and the dynamic filter within the date filter of the Story...neither of which is selectable by the end user which is critical??

!image-2020-11-10-15-48-11-434.png!

2. A secondary enhancement as well would be enhancing the time navigation options, when you do a forecast for a current year you may want to look ahead. In the time navigation it would also be helpful to have FORWARD time navigation and not just backward.

We have five products A, B, C, D, E with sales quantity = 10 for each product. We set up a restricted measure called *Total* with constant selection for products to get the total sales quantity across products. We get the *Total* value 10+10+10+10+10= 50.??

As an reporting user (like a controller) I would like to have the show and hide columns in a SAC Story and save this as a bookmark.

??

Business Scenario

The Controller in question goes into a report that contains ACT, FC, BUD and YoY changes, for all four quarters, in a table. They only need ACT, but another controller only needs FC, so we are showing all four measures in the report. To save time, both Controllers would like to hide all columns they don't need and bookmark the report, so that they can use it every time with just one click.

??

Value added

The nature of financial reporting alone makes such a feature very necessary, as these reports are used monthly by all controllers and it makes no sense to have a report for every single use case. Instead, a bookmark of the optimal column layout that is also shareable amongst team members and management would greatly improve usability and reduce effort on Controlling and system level.

|1|Creation of Report|A story designer creates a story that contains charts and tables with a hierarchy as well as a geo chart with several measures to accommodate different use cases|
|2|Opening the Report & changing any drill level a viewer can change|A consumer (no edit right) opens the report and hides the unnecessary measure in a table/chart, or unhides?? one they need in particular, using interaction on the widget.|
|3|Saving personalized bookmark|As the consumer always wants to have the view and customization, a bookmark can be saved by this consumer. The bookmark will save all modifications the viewer has done including the hidden/unhidden elements.|
|4|Opening a bookmarked report|When opening the bookmark the elements states are shown as they were bookmarked|

Cause
There was once a case change of <NameID> attribute value of invalid users in the Custom Identity Provider, for example from uppercase to lowercase.
SAP Cloud Platform was caching their <nameID> in uppercase, although both the SAC Users page and <NameID> value in the SAML Assertion were lowercase.

Also, if possible, it would be good to see which system tier the webpage belongs to (Modeling, Test, Production or Validation)?? This will enhance the UX quite a lot. Examples of how this will be beneficial are:
 ??
 * When you have many tabs open, you will quickly recognize which pages are open exactly. Currently you have to examine each and every one of them (see screenshot 2 attached)
 * We often have to compare the same story/dashboard/data source across systems tiers (Production vs. Modeling, for example), hence it gets pretty confusing especially when you have many tabs open. If we can see both the name of the page as well as the system tier it belongs to, that will remove all confusions we would not have to click through many tabs just to find the one we need
 * When viewing history in your browser, we would not see ""SAP Analytics Cloud"" multiple times but rather meaningful webpage names (screenshot 3 attached). I can give you an example of workflow that would use this - You go through the Files structure to find a story you want to check, you check it and then you need to go back to the file structure to check another story in the same subfolder. Now you have to remember how many steps to go back or guess where to click, but with the proper webpage title it will be resolved
 * When you bookmark SAC pages, they all populate the name ""SAP Analytics Cloud"", so everybody must manually rename all the bookmarks to be meaningful. The proper webpage title will eliminate this problem

So, value adds are clear - less unproductive time spent trying to find that specific story model etc. that you want right now, less mess in bookmarks, less manual effort maintaining bookmarks, less chance of accidentally editing something in the wrong system tier (when you have the same story open in different tiers for comparison) and overall nicer look and feel.

Hopefully is easy to implement and everybody can benefit from this UX improvement soon.

P.S. there is one more tipfor this feature that if implemented, it will be really much better:\{{??}}When browsing file structure, it would be good to see in the title which folder is opened (screenshot 4)

Expose account dimension in page and story filters (New Model),FPA34-6874,9561910,User Story,Open,FPA34,High,I866445,D043474,I818705,4/16/2021 14:47,10/22/2021 16:09,9/29/2022 10:01,,,,"BI (Charts, Explorer, Geo, Input controls, etc.)","Planning (Allocations, VDT, etc.)",,,,,,"*Issue*
Page and story filter do not expose the account dimension. This severely hampers story designers working with ""expensive"" models: For such models even simple queries may run minutes, and story designers typically need to filter on a few members of the account dimension to get to acceptable query runtimes. 

For tables, the only workflow achieving this today is ridiculous: First create a very restrictive page or story filter using dimensions other than account, insert a table widget, open the designer panel, filter using the account dimension member selector in the designer panel, remove the page or story filter. 

*Scope*  
Expose the account dimension for page and story filters (see the attached slide for the present implementation of page and story filters NOT exposing the account dimension).

*Expected performance gain*
* For the ""expensive"" Tarte model, table without account filter vs. table with proper account filter: OOO after 300 sec down to 5 sec.
* For the Puerto de Coronel model, table without account filter vs. table with proper account filter: From 300-80 sec down to 2 sec.",1,1

Spike to investigate how to support monitoring workflow for BW.

Customer validation of Workflow MVS raised an issue that the Smart Detect style monitoring or time based variances will not support live BW,.

The issues with monitoring are:
 # Often BW queries do not return a time dimension.
 # The time dimension may not be relevant to data so showing how the value changed may not add value. showing change over fiscal periods for example may be more useful.
 # Showing change over calendar time may not be useful for certain use cases as the time frame returned by the query may be very short.
 # Change over time information may be represented as restricted measures such as (previous period, previous year)

Additionally ad-hoc Info worker monitoring of fields might be misleading as knowledge of the data may be required to understand if it is safe to continue to monitor a value. For example if the story is updated every month to reflect current time periods the value may become out of date.

Purpose of the spike is to:
 * Investigate and recommend approaches for supporting monitoring in BW.
 * Validate with BW PM that approach is valid.
 * Validate with customers that approach is valid.
 ** Is?? impersonation require and acceptable?
 ** Is cloud connector configuration acceptable and worth the cost for monitoring?
 ** Is caching data in SAC to enable monitoring acceptable?

Possible approaches for monitoring:
 # Snapshotting the data
 # Analyst configuration to support monitoring through restricted measures.
 # Adopting Smart Detect to work on BW

??Possible approach for managing ad-hoc monitoring of data:
 # Analyst configuration to control watchable fields.
 # Warning users of prompts and functionality to adjust them",1,1

*Scope:*
 * Simple Threshold based alert - rule based
 * Full support for acquired, Live HANA, Live BW4HANA and Live BW On HANA at minimum.
 * Analysts can create Alerts and assign to users
 * Alert on a data point e.g. revenue or revenue for NA
 * Alert is configured at a story level rather than being associated with data or an Insight
 * Alert configuration by Admin
 ** Admin can define rule based threshold e.g if target > x
 ** Set how frequent the rule is tested and the alert is potentially raised (could be hardcoded initially )??
 ** Change the alert settings
 ** Remove the alert??
 * Notification through email
 * Notification in mobile App
 * Notification in SAC notifications
 * Opening an alert opens the associated story
 * The alert text must to be available/displayed in the story

 * Integration/consolidation with Data change Insights (snapshots)
 * Analyst configuration of alerts
 * Transporting alerts between systems - export/import
 * Explanation??- utilising Smart Insight to explain the alert
 * Smart Detection of changes
 * Share an alert with another user

*Questions/TODO*
 * Should alerts be data or insight related rather than story related
 * how should alert text be provided at the story level
 * would email only alerts be sufficient??for MVS
 * what is the minimum set of rules required for adoption
 * Does broader sAc strategy impact required data sources (DWC)
 * How are rules tested - on log in, by technical user, through impersonation
 * 

*Risks*
 * Scheduling currently has licensing limitation which may impact alerts.
 * Related features - reporting and data change insight in Analytical Applications already exist.

??

*Info Worker focused vs Admins focused*

Ideally Analysts and Info Workers should both be able to create alerts. Analysts should be able to assign them and users should be able to share. An Admin based approach will enable adoption as alerts can be configured as part of content development and we can gauge customer need for Info Worker based alerting.?? Smart Alerts features may supersede the need for Info Worker configured alerts.

SCIM API PUT /Users/UserID with x-ignore-roles-if-missing=true need to respects Roles AND allow updates to isConcurrent,FPA34-7202,10713235,User Story,Open,FPA34,High,I055049,I049477,I049477,10/14/2021 13:13,10/20/2021 10:02,9/29/2022 10:01,,,,Developer/APIs,,,,,,,"Customers needing the  x-ignore-roles-if-missing=true feature for updating users via the SCIM API PUT /Users/UserID request need to update the users' isConcurrent property.

Today, the initial design of this feature is the isConcurrent property is NOT updatable or changeable when the http header x-ignore-roles-if-missing=true is used.

This is a problem, because when header x-ignore-roles-if-missing=true is used, its because the 'client' system doesn't know the roles. So, this is fine when updating a user as the roles are then respected, even when the roles are omitted from the requestBody. However, the isConcurrent property (even when specified in the requestBody) can't be changed.

This means, if a customer wants to update the isConcurrent property they need to know the roles the user has. But they simple won't because they would only use the x-ignore-roles-if-missing=true feature when they don't know what the roles are. It thus doesn't really make sense to respect roles, but deny any update to isConcurrent.

The customer 'Co-op' requires the need to update a users' isConcurrent property and still have any assigned roles correctly respected even when not specified in the requestBody.

The customer 'Hilti' is also highly likely to need the same (currently checking with the CEE).

 # Change the font size of axis label ( It can operate, but didn't work)??
 # Try to set Axis Label Truncation ( It can't operate)

As part of FUE based licensing, we would follow?? the calculations as below

{color:#00875a}Number of publications Per?? Hour = 5 * (Number of BI Users per FUE) *Number of FUE credits /100{color}

??

{color:#ff0000}Note : For now, the variable what we knwo so far for Number of BI Users per FUE credit is 5 BI?? Users per FUE unit . PLease keep this a a variable or try checking from licensing team API if this value is available so that we can make use of the same directly instead putting it statically.{color}

??

E.g:

If a customer has 100 FUE credits , then the customer can create 5*5*100/100 = 25 Publications an hour

??

FOR NOW, ONE FUE CREDIT IS EQUAL TO 5 BI USERS

SO, NUMBER OF PUBLICATIONS PER HOUR = 5*FUE?? OR

20 FUE = 5 PUBLICATIONS AN HOUR

Reference :

{color:#ff0000}+20 FUE Credits = 100 BI Users = 5 Publications an hour+{color}

??

+Some of the Rules which needs to be considered for FUE based scheduling publications+??
 # Publications can only be sent to Active users and Inactive users won't receive any publications - Check to be done during Create / Run time for sending.
 # ??If there are active users while creating the publications but while running the actual users, some of the users are inactive, Publications to those inactive users are not sent, includes even for Teams

??

??
h4. +Approach for more understanding which can be though through:+

??

+Schedule Creation time+
 # ??When creating the schedule , try to check the limits?? for number of publications per hour based on FUE and create the schedule .
 # Checking for recipients on active and inactive users can be done while generating the publications as?? anyways we need to do then. For now,w e can add users/?? teams from the available list.

??

+Publications Generation time+
 # Before generating the publications, check if there is one active users available in the recipients list

?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ??

+Broadcast Scenario+
 # If there are 0?? active users in the recipients list , don't generate the publications and fail that view?? with a message for failing active users??
 # ??If there is a minimum of one active user , generate the publications but send to only active users in the list??

+Bursting Scenario+
 * Check each recipients in the list and if that recipient is an active user, then generate the publication and send to that recipients??
 * ??Same rule as above applies for users in Teams

??

??*How FUE License Co-exists with existing Classic Licenses*??

??

It can co-exists with Classic?? license , E.g , Customer?? can have a few FUE based license and few classic licenses.

The count formula for number of publications pe rhour needs to be the total sum based on classic license + FUE based license.??

??

*Summary :*

??

On a high level , Three stuffs we need to do where third step is somethign which would require more thought process in managing active / inactive users:
 # *Eligibility*??if Publications is Possible : Check would include Classic Licenses (If any available ) + 5* FUE > 25 User license

 # Number of Publications calculations = (5% of total number of classic licenses if any available ) + 25% of FUE Licenses

 # Check for any inactive user before generating/sending publications to them.

SAC Analytics Designer has a Planning Model method called createMembers that creates new member entries in a dimension. The current behavior when using createMembers for an existing member is to overwrite the existing description/properties, but this seems more suitable for a method like updateMembers.?? Because it's not possible to create a new member with the same ID, we'd would expect the API to return some kind of warning similar to that shown in the Modeler UI. _""That name already exists. Please choose another name.""_

??

*Use Case Example:*??

For our Headcount Operations use case, we are using the createMembers method to create sequential Member ID's on demand and found that when multiple users click at the same time and try to create the same member, they can overwrite the other users member along with their Description and Properties. If there was some way to see an error when this happens, we could prevent this.

Need Development team to resolve this issue to ensure an 'Opt-in' pop up appears even in SSO situation to abide by GDPR rules.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. log in to SAC Tenant as an admin user.

2. Create a new user and open the initial invite email.

3. When the link is opened in the SSO scenario, a pop-up doesn't appear and when the link is opened in the Incognito window without SSO, then the below pop-up appears which is what is required even in the SSO scenario.

The DSGVO departments wants to have this user id in anonym way or deleted completely.

SCIM API to manage (create/read/update/delete) data access controls on models,FPA34-7164,10540630,User Story,Open,FPA34,Medium,,I049477,I049477,9/20/2021 8:54,9/20/2021 9:07,9/29/2022 10:01,,,,Developer/APIs,Modeling ,System Administration ,,,,,"Today with Acquired and Planning models it is possible to enable 'Data Access Control' within a model. Once enabled, individual dimension values can be set for 'read' and/or 'write' permissions.

It means row level security for acquired data models is supported.

 !image-2021-09-20-09-44-03-409.png|thumbnail! 

The entries into this table can be:
* made manually by typing or selecting the user and/or team
* pasted (using the OS clipboard)

And if the dimension is a public dimension then you can also be
* updated (and on a scheduled basis) via a data source (potentially reading a database table for example once a day)

(There are a good number of limitation regarding the length and number of values that can be entered into a signal cell or entry)

Customers, however, need to programmatically update this table of access rights via an API to ease the integration with provisioning solutions (includes ones from SAP). However such solutions (including ones from SAP) don't offer an 'SQL' or query interface since such solutions are designed to call an API, like the SCIM API. 

*Thus this ER is for the current SCIM API to be extended to allow for this data access control 'table' to be updated for public and non-public dimensions for acquired (analytics and planning) models.*

The API should enable READ (to read all the current values) and to update one or all of them. Ideally, the API should support a PATCH call to either 'add' or 'remove' an individual (or team) to or from the 'READ' or 'WRITE' entries without the need to read and update all the entries (even for a single individual dimension value)

The limitation of the number of entries per 'cell' is out of scope for this ER, but should be handled separately. 

(Related info: limitation per cells is 30 users (and 30 teams?) per entry. But, if you cut and paste values into a single entry (a cell) you can specify a lot more than 30, you can specify up to a limit of 5000 characters!)

as the creator of a connection , I would like to share the ownership of this connection with a team or at least with other users.

In case of vacation or illness, there might be no user to share an existing connection. Also after importing a connection, all sharing settings of the connection are lost 
and as only the creator/first importer is able to share the connection, this could lead to issues when he/she is not available.

 # If a model already exists, datasets are not available as an import source.

??

What is needed is to be able to for the following:

The ability to add a dataset to the data foundation import chain after creation.?? This way, a model created via structure first workflows can also consume a dataset fact table, or if a user discovers that the data was already imported into a dataset, there is no need to re-acquire from the original source.

The ability to choose to bring the wrangling along in the initial mapping.?? This should copy the wrangling, as it might need to be modified to mate with the model.?? This presumes that data foundation wrangling jobs can be updated.

An option to automatically update the fact table when a dataset us updated.?? So if a dataset has an append operation, that append operation should also be applied to models that consume that dataset as part of their data import chain.?? E.g. if a dataset has a scheduled update and a model fed from that dataset has an auto-update, those scheduled import jobs will apply to BOTH the dataset and model.

An option to schedule updates from a dataset.?? This would not follow the automated, dependency update from the point above, but would treat the dataset as if it were any other data source.

when importing master data from S/4HANA the value help for filter on members in the query does not list all values.

??Behavior is the same as Objects in Public Content.

The content Network transport user should be able to transport the content only he is authorized to transport.

_For example_ 

If there are 2 workspaces ( Human Resource, Finance ) in the ystem.??

User A is workspace administrator for only Finance. He should be able to see and transport only Finance content.

??

The user needs to be an admin to transport workspace objects, as create workspace authorization is available only for System Administrator.

Today, as a story designer, I cannot create time calculations which allow for ?€?Previous Year?€? or ?€?Previous Period?€? (time navigation functions within restricted measures) to be based off of a User-selected reference Time selection (i.e. via Calculation Input Control, Date Page Filter or Custom Date Filter), ignoring Story filters. The out-of-the-box ?€?Previous Year?€? or ?€?Previous Period?€? functions only reference System Date, which do not allow a user to select the reference. E.g. Today?€?s date is 2021, ?€?Previous Year?€? will be 2020 whereas a user may want to select 2019 and have the ?€?Previous Year?€? be 2018 for their comparison. If we use the other time functions instead (e.g. Offset range filters) they ignore the hierarchy drills, meaning in June of 2021 the restricted measure value will show the entire 2021 value in the month of June versus only the June value of 2020. In these other functions the hierarchy drill state is completely ignored OR the offset is ignored defined in the input control (*please see attached word document to show 3 attempted use cases. Use Case 1 is what is desired with the additional flexibility noted in this enhancement request).*

??

*Expectation: ?€?*

I, as a story designer, want to have an ability to create time calculations which allow for ?€?Previous Year?€? or ?€?Previous Period?€? (time navigation functions within restricted measures) to be based off of a User-selected reference Time selection, also while ignoring any potential Story Filters.

*Background:*??

Highly asked for by planning and reporting users to perform out of the box variance and comparative analysis in both Charts and Tables. This scenario would extremely improve??the overall productivity of all users. The result of this capability is primarily for End User (consumer) persona, since in this use case the ask is for flexibility for end user (consumer) to be able to make selections in View mode to drive the Charts and Tables.

A BW query contains a characteristic and a hierarchy based on this characteristic where the characteristic contains??*no text*??but the hierarchy contains external characteristics that may contain texts.

In this case the client may not retrieve texts for the nodes in the hierarchy that contains external characteristics with texts. The reason is that the client can only requests texts based on the hierarchy base characteristic that has no text in this use case; in addition the concept of external characteristics is not exposed in BW InA, so it is impossible to requests texts for external characteristics.

To allow to retrieve texts in this use case the client may request the default text for the hierarchy base characteristic. In this case the BW InA protocol requests the default text for all external characteristics with texts contained in the hierarchy. In the BW InA protocol the client has to set the capability??""TextInHierarchy""??to be able to use this feature. This note will be updated when SAC supports and uses this new capability.

??

BW already provided a fix, SAC needs to adapt.

 ** BHP need to consider dimension only appear in filter, example, BHP has dimension ?€?PlanYear?€? ( not a time dimension) filtered with single value in table. Different ?€?PlanYear?€? may have different description.
 * Attribute value should be shown for every member of dimensions which are in row but not used in formula
 ** [d/Operating Product Group] is not part of the commenting key hence we show comment for every dimension member of [d/Operating Product Group] in the slice

h2. Dimension Comment formula
 * New formula syntax to be introduce for ?€?line item description?€? use case: = _dimcomment_??( [d/Dim 1], [d/Dim 2], [d/Dim 3] )
 * New context menu entry to add as new calculation
 * DimensionComment column will be the *first column* after dimensions in row axis.
 * No association with any data column, no need to include ?€?Time-all?€?, no need to hide column.
 * In initial release, in one table widget, only accept *one definition* of such formula in *column* axis.
 * *Dimensions in row axis are mentioned in formula by default,* and user can modify the dimensions in formula on demand.
 ** For example,??[d/Operating Account], [d/Operating Regions], [d/Operating Product Group] are selected as rows in table & hence used by default

h2. Editing dimension comment (inline editing, copy&paste, deletion)
 * Double click into attribute cell, then edit *existing dimension comment like the way of editing data cell*.
 ** Note: different from data cell, there is *NO background color change* for dimension comment cells after value change.
 * User can *copy and paste* dimension comment values in same table, across tables within same table, across tables from another story, and from excel spreadsheet
 * Pasted dimension comment will overwrite existing dimension comment
 * *Paste empty string(null or space) will delete existing comment,* user need to confirm this on popup(?)
 * *Copy & paste dimension comment and data in one shot*
 ** Technically, the request of saving dimension comment and the request of saving data are two separate ones. There might be the case that saving dimension comment succeeds but saving data fails, or vice versa.
 * Allow only plain text
 * User can *delete comment* via keyboard - delete, paste empty value, and enter empty value
 * *Is there any case that dimension comment cell should be input disabled*?
 * As comment is not revertible, after editing, this confirmation dialog should appear only once per session and per attribute column for any editing (inline editing, copy&paste, deletion).??FPA00-40397

Unless specified otherwise blending will use the _Description_ attribute to try and match data between two models; this means that:
 * Every row from the primary model sub-query will match with every row from the secondary model sub-query since they will all have an empty string value.
 * First of all this results in a lot of extra processing which may cause very high resource utilization depending on the size of data in the model.
 * Secondly this can result in unexpected results being returned where every row in the final result will have the same value for measures coming from the secondary model and will have an aggregated and/or duplicated value warning for the measure.
 * Data points like these should have Blending Aggregate and/or Blending Duplicate warning message(s) displayed in the Chart/Table detail section (and when hovering over bars/cells) since for a given linked dimension member the same aggregated value may be repeated.

This default behavior is among the top root causes of blend queries that:
* Outright fail, sometimes with a high resource utilization message.
* Succeed:
** With unexpected data from one or more of the models being matched.
** With a much higher resource utilization than expected.

See also KBA [2914189|https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2914189]. Please ask our support organisation to give you an estimate on how many customer incidents are related to this issue.

From a database engineering perspective, the decision to consider the description attribute instead of the id for the joins is highly questionable in any case. Changing the default behavior to have ""link id - id"" always preselected would be an easy-to-implement fix that would avoid this issue.

Comment from the Siemens FocuS/4 stakeholders:

""The left sidebar seems static and not suitable in terms of single point of entry for different reports and technologies.""

It is expected that the generic Catalog user at Siemens is rather focused on topics and organizational structures when looking for content. He does not care so much about whether different reporting assets are provided as SAC stories, Digital Board Rooms, EXCEL reports or within other reporting tools, as long as he can quickly locate the information he is looking for.

Analytics Catalog is well-established at many large enterprises and is often the single entry point for business users??to all of their Analytical assets.

Many customers - among others Signify and Decathlon - want to directly explore data models in Analytics Catalog as well.??

This is due to the following benefits:??
 * Business Users can create their own data exploration - personalized to their needs and independently of IT / Analysts.??
 * Business Users can use pre-defined filters to easily navigate to the right data model for exploration
 * The model description in Analytics Catalog provides model details and establishes trust
 * The ""Favorites"" option allows everyone to highlight a specific model that is frequently used for Exploration
 * Only ""official"" models can be accessed by the end-users

Moreover,??Data Exploration (based on Data Analyzer) will have its own Module with SAC Release QRC Q4 2021 and thereby become an integral part of SAC. It should therefore integrate seamlessly with all components.??

??

*Feature Requirement:*

With SAC Release QRC Q3 2021 Analytics Catalog includes SAC Models - they can be published by SAC Content Creators and Business Users can search for them via Catalog.??

*This request is about enriching every data model with the option to ""Explore with Data Analyzer"". This option should be available both on the Tile View (for quick jump) and Detailed View.*??

Attached are two ideas how this could be implemented.??

Note: It needs to be evaluated whether the model publisher should get the option to ""enable"" or ""disable"" the exploration of the model via data analyzer. Might not be required as the intention of sharing models with users via Catalog is to let them discover them.??",1,1

Currently, you can only change the folder owner if the owner is deleted from the system.

So, if a user leaves the company we can not change his ownership.??Also, sometimes there can be other reasons to change the owner, he may change to a non related department for example.

This can also help to accomplish segregation of duties. The owner can share the folder with any person or team even if the folder is in Public.

Part of Bookmark enhancements??FPA34-3860

*Problem statement:*

With addition of new actions story viewer can bookmark, the viewer may want to have greater control over what the bookmark captures to avoid bookmark error states such as ""bookmark partially applied"" tokens when an original story has been changed, but the change does not affect the elements of the story the viewer intended to bookmark.??

*Proposed solution:*

The bookmark to only capture story elements that the viewer interacted with. For example:

Story has 3 story filters and 2 page filters.

Story viewer changed the value for 1 story filter and 1 page filter.

Story viewer created a new bookmark. Bookmark only captured 1 story filter and 1 page filter story viewer interacted with.

??

This solution will help to reduce the number of error states with bookmarks. As an example:

Story viewer creates a story with 2 story filters.

Viewer changes the selection of story filter 2 and creates a bookmark. Bookmark only captures the selection of story filter 2.??

Story designer now changes the selection for story filter 1.

Viewer's bookmark is not affected by this change. (while with current behaviour of bookmark capturing the whole story, the viewer would now see a token"" bookmark has been partially applied"")",1,1

We are aware of the functionality to add URLs in this case, but this leads to 2 issues.
 # We are building pre-defined content for finance in SAC. If we only can add full URLs to the link the customer has to adapt every link manually after import. Furthermore we somehow need some dummy link for packaging. This is cumbersome for the customer and they need to know about the inconvenience to change the URL after import. This process is error prone and not very user friendly.
 # If the customer wants to transport their development from DEV to PROD landscape (tenant) they need to manually adapt all links in PROD again. This is exactly against the reason you install a 2-tier landscape.

Currently the cascade option in input controls is only a **visual** guide to prevent a user from selecting a filter that would result in charts/tables not showing any data. It does not actually change the filter selection that is sent.

??

This is confusing because as you make selections in the input controls, the members that are displayed in the other input controls change?€? and so it looks like the selection has been changed.

??

This is also contradictory because table and charts also only display the visually filtered data, thus further reinforcing that the filter selection has dynamically changed?€? but backend actions such as Planning/Data Actions do not and still use the actual selection?€? which causes confusion.

??

We would like SAC to behave consistently and to provide better user information on what is and is not selected.

??

Given that the cascading option has already done the hard work of visually filtering the input controls, we would ideally like this dynamic selection to become an actual selection so that backend actions use the same selection as tables and charts. If this is not possible then the input controls should display what is selectable but not have them selected. The user can then manually select the desired members.

??

??

The above image shows three input controls with the cascading option enabled. The input controls are Region, Subregion and Sales Account. To help the user select the correct Sales Account they first choose a Region and then Subregion. In the screenshot the Sales Account input control has been dynamically changed to only show two Sales Accounts and these have been automatically selected. These were not selected by the user. Also note the table in the background is only displaying the two dynamically selected Sales Accounts.

??

But that is not the actual selection and the clue is the number in parenthesis beside Sales Account?€? 283. That is the actual number of Sales Accounts selected and that is what is used by backend actions.

??

Also note that this ?€?selected?€? number is only shown for Story filters. If the Input Control was a Page Filter then there is no ?€?selected?€? number and the user then has no clue what is and is not selected.

??

Referring to the attached screenshot, if the user needs backend actions to actually only use the two dynamically selected members, they must first unselect ?€?All?€?, and then manually reselect the two members. Of course this becomes more laborious if there are more selections.

 However, for reasons of space the unit/currency column should be hidden, but it is not possible to hide the row/column.

If a table in a story contains data that is all in the same unit/currency, then the symbol of the currency is not displayed by default.

 * private content can't be migrated. This forced BMW to move their content to the public folder, create the necessary authorizations on it, and migrate it from the public into the other tenant.
 * also some questions about technical ID's regarding content migration came up and slowed them down
 * SSO/SAML Configuration issues

In precise value that is chosen is not captured appropriately .
Since we have other tabs also , if we have an action that gets captured when catalog tab is set as default tab will be helpful.
 
We have a question for Enable or disable the catalog tab.
Value associated to the action ( Enable/disable)  is not showing the correct numbers.
 
Unpublished is also an action getting captured  when a user publishes the content which  should not be captured as we do not have the option to unpublish the content from catalog
 
Two actions show up such as
 
a.  Publishing
b. Publishing to all users
when the content is published to the catalog whether it is a team or to All users.

As a platform administrator from ID&A perspective I would like to control which user can use the linked analysis functionality in stories during QEC.??

*Problem space:*

We recognized that linked analysis could result in performance issues for SAC depending on how it is designed by a modeler and we would like to prevent the usage of this feature during our QEC stabilization phase.

*Background / Use-case:*

In the past we recognized performance issues during the QEC through stories using linked analysis. The execution of these stories was then manually switched- off during the hot phase of the QEC. Unfortunately, such a story switch-off was only resolved after the performance problems of the related story occurred. 
A possibility to control linked analysis during the hot phase of the QEC would reduce and simplify the time for an manual analysis and switch-off of the stories.",1,1

 * On the target tenant the importer's name should be visible and the accompanying timestamp when the package was imported.
 * In case of multiple exports/imports happen with different objects/options, it might be a good idea to make these columns an array.

All these information is available in the ""activities' however that area not too user friendly, and not everyone could have access to all the security information of the SAC tenant just to browse export/import times and usernames.

DXC and many big strategic customers have requested for this featuure.

When they export Models to a file through the Data Management tab in a Model :

When they choose the ""Fact Data Only"" option, it shows how many records are exported.??

When they choose the ""Fact Data and Account Calculations"" or ""Account Calculations only"" option, it doesnt show how many records are exported to the file. When the model is huge and the no: of rows exceed 1 million to under 6 million, data gets exported to multiple files and in those cases customers would be having difficulty in understanding how many records are getting exported in each file and if their are any missing records. Data validation after the export is very difficult esp. when data is exported to multiple files and when they automate the process where files get pickup by the data source.??

Can we also show the no: of records exported to each file just like the way we show for??""Fact Data Only"" option.

This is the critical requirement from DXC.

*Example from Corporate Overview DiBo Team:*

With respect to responsive pages and the limited space of mobile devices ?€? especially smartphones ?€? headers, charts, text fields, etc. show up in a fixed sequence depending on lanes and positions. Since we are especially forced to add background images within a lane, we need to put all charts and other components in only one single lane to be able to display the image over the whole page. On a phone, charts are always displayed in the same order (from left to right), see example picture: First, the trend chart of SAP, second, SAPs specific numeric points, third the trend chart of Oracle, fourth, Oracle?€?s numeric points and so on.

We know that the order can be managed via page lanes, but even within a lane you have to be careful. Therefore, it would more than helpful to manually create a custom component order.

In our current state we do not meet the customer needs by binding the WRITE members in the filter, as they are used in the planning stories.?? Rather we have 2 options, with or without hide parents switch.?? The net effect of choosing this method is either the user sees all members under a node and has to guess where they may plan (only when submit occurs will they know) or they turn on the hide parents and you see only those members you have access to in the filter. BUT now that user cannot run any summary report since they don't have read access to the parent node. If they did, they would again see all the members.??

??

I propose a method to bind the WRITE access to a filter using a switch on the Story/page filter, that controls calling only the members that have user write access. That way, a report developer would be able to control in a story what gets presented to a user, but also allows a user to have a READ access along the dimension parent hierarchy.

Planners would be best served if they would see a filter that defines the available WRITE members of a given dimension, so that we don't have unhappy customers from submitting data to an incorrect member, or because they are limited to only seeing a small subset of model dimension members from a reporting perspective.

*AS-IS:*

When a chart has no data to display, we get a grey text message ""Change drill level"". We also get a red exclamation mark beside the Hierarchy icon that says ""Change drill level"".?? But, usually the problem has nothing to do with the drill level and can't be fixed by changing drill level. The issue is usually an invalid combination of Story/Page/Chart/Version/Date filtering. But we never get any warning or messages about incompatible filter settings.

*TO-BE:*

1) Simple solution: change the text to ?€?Try changing the drill level and/or filters?€? and don?€?t have the alert connected to the Hierarchy icon.

!image-2020-10-25-14-50-08-779.png|width=680,height=188!

2) Innovative solution: the software should detect whether chart is displaying a lower level of a hierarchy, or are the results being filtered. The error message should be intelligently connected to the current state of the chart and give context-appropriate advice. Can the software tell me whether the problem is caused by drill level or by my filters?

*Steps to reproduce*
 # Create a bar chart and a assign a measure
 # assign a dimension that has a hierarchy
 # drill the chart to level 2
 # create a filter on a dimension member that doesn't have data for this measure
 # misleading error message is shown and tells user to drill up

As a Controller who is responsible for a Business Unit, I would like to be able to analyze, compare and change different Forecast and Budget versions also from the past in one report, so that I don?€?t have to do downloads every month to do this comparison.

(attached a documentation how the drop down boxes in BEx Web Templates are filled that end-users can easily use the dropdown boxes)

??

Business Scenario
 * Reports that enable mid-year analysis as to whether the defined targets can be reached, that is, budget deviation analyses, forecast analyses, actual analyses but also YOY Growth analysis
 * Possibility to analyze suspicious postings and correct this
 * Margin Analysis (Plan/actual analyses, including over time, analysis of target achievement within SAP?€?s portfolio and products, analysis of contribution margins of individual products and product groups/portfolio categories)
 * Analyze performance of measures to reduce costs and increase revenue
 * To improve quality of cost allocation

Value added

It is important to have all necessary measures in a report to analyze and compare the data in time. Mostly it is during budget or forecast cycles and it is always under time pressure. Data must be checked in detail to inform managers why the targets are not reached and what can be done to improve in the next cycle the forecast. For that it is very important to have drop down boxes in a report where we can easily switch forecast and budget versions. We do not compare only the current open FC and the last closed we compare forecasts from all month/quarter of the fiscal year. It helps us a lot that we have always prefilled columns which can be changed by us with the entries of the drop-down boxes. We do not have to do excel downloads to get the data from past quarters.",1,1

h2. Navigate Back to the Story

Once in Data Analyzer, User should be able to navigate back to the story where he came from, and he expects to go back to the same state of the story. This is expected irrespective of whether the data analyzer view is saved by user or not
h2. Saving of data analyzer views

In case a user would like to save his analysis, he would be able to save as data analyzer insights in SAC repository.??
 * ??When user goes back from data analyzer to story If insight was not saved, analysis done by user is lost and if he launches data analyzer again, he needs to start afresh
 * When user goes back from data analyzer to story If insight was saved, user should be able to navigate to insight directly from the right click menu of chart/table.
 * This means the saved insights should be linked back to stories somehow so that user does not have to necessarily look/search for that insight

At the customer we see that they store version information on the second structure dimension. In order to achieve an IBCS compliant styling, the user needs to be able to style e.g. each bar in a bar chart with color and pattern.

Builder Panel from BSH:
!Bildschirmfoto 2022-07-25 um 14.48.43.png|thumbnail!

*Pain Point*
Currently the user could only use assign colors but there only color and no pattern is available.

*Additional information*
At BMW the version information was also stored in a generic dimension called value type. Here it's also not very convenient to style each bar correctly. Current workaround there is to use restricted Measures.
Restricted Measures can't be used in the use case with the second structure because SAC does not support to restrict a measure based on the second structure.

*Possible Solution Spaces that were identified*
 - allow in the Modeler to define second structure as version dimension and let the user add the semantics in the model (this would help so that the table also can automatically add the IBCS patterns)
 - allow user to create restricted measures that restrict on members of the second structure
 - enhance the assign colors panel so you can also add patterns

*Additional Note:*

- is the remote model the right place -> how is the future of remote models",1,1

Creating a settings page that contains all calculation input controls.

*Steps to reproduce:*
 * Create a KPI Chart with e.g. a restricted Measure that has a calculation input control on versions
 * The calculation input control is created
 * Now the goal is to create a settings page where we will bring all calculation input controls together

??

*Observed behavior:*
I can't move the calculation input control to another page.
The user is at a dead end in this scenario, the only way to get the Input Control to the desired page is to adapt the calculation and recreate the Input Control on the correct page.

??

*Expected behavior:*
Same as for other input controls where I can copy, for the Calculation Input controls I would expect that I can move the Calc IC to another page.
Alternatively copying them and syncing both Calc ICs would be an even more flexible solution.

This stops cross-calculations from being a valid use case in forms where data entry is required on one cross-calculation but not on another. This also poses a security defect as users could enter data on ""locked"" regions by using a cross-calculation to bypass the data locks. The work-arounds for this limitation are: (1) to configure cell locking, however this is not possible in Analytics Designer. It is also not dynamic when a user changes the drill state of a dimension in a table. (2) If the entire table can be locked (i.e. no data entry required) then Planning Enabled setting can be turned off. However this limits a whole host of business planning scenarios. Neither work-around fully addresses the needs of many common planning scenarios. What is the opportunity/problem the request will address? Opportunity: By enabling data locking on Restricted Measures in stories &amp; analytics applications developers &amp; consultants can use restricted measures and be sure they are secure in planning projects. This also allows more sophisticated planning forms to be created for specific end user need. Problem: Restricted Measure security is not consistent with the rest of SAC Data Locking principles and is a potential risk for customers looking to manage the data entry process for their business. What is the expected benefit? 1) Improve the consistency of data locking principles across an SAC planning system. 2) Give customers more confidence they can safely use data locking functionality without risk of incorrect entry. 3) Address a very common requirement of being able to see summarized/restricted (but also protected) data in the same table where planned values are required.

I could foresee several interesting use cases:

??**??
 * {*}Data Maintenance{*}: As a user, I am missing a data entry or want to correct an entry and could call the DWC CLI to maintain data ?€? physically or virtually ?€? in the Data Editor of DWC directly from the Story 



 * {*}Data Harmonization{*}: As a user, I could (re-)harmonize data records when I realize in a story that e.g. a customer opportunity is mapped to the wrong account executive. We have the Intelligent Lookup in DWC as our harmonization engine and such a manual mapping could be triggered via the CLI. 



 * {*}Data Sharing{*}: I might realize in the story that I would like to enhance a dataset that is used in a story but does not have access to it in my modeling environment. I could call the CLI to share the underlying model into one of my spaces. This is especially of interest if a central department provides access to stories where only read-only consumption is allowed and for modelling self-service, you need your own space. 



 * {*}Data Marketplace{*}: I could trigger a new update of the data in a data product if the data is outdated. 



 * {*}Data Integration{*}: I could trigger the flow of a data integration job.

??
 * {*}Performance{*}: I could trigger the snapshotting of a view in case the live connection delivers not to my expectation and I have an important meeting where I want to freeze the data for better performance.

??

I hope these examples show where a user could benefit if he can call the DWC CLI as part of an analytical application. Down the road, we obviously want to have all these use cases natively integrated into SAC but until this happens, the Analytics Designer could be a nice option.

MuleSoft is expecting SAC to handle the Skiptoken value dynamically and send it back to request next page of records. This functionality of dynamic handling of Skiptoken is not supported by SAC. What is the opportunity/problem the request will address? The request will help in successfully importing all the required data from SF in a single SAC import job request.

If you try to add an equipment with the exact same tag or serial number of an existing equipment already listed in the model, it would throw an error that the tag or serial number you are trying to add is already in use else you could have the following situation which is obviously incorrect because you shouldn't have the same serial number for two different equipments: SERIAL NUMBER EQUIPMENT TYPE BRAND MODEL QUANTITY 12345 Computer Dell Latitude 7300 1 12345 Monitor LG 24GN600 2 What is the opportunity/problem the request will address?

In the first page of the dashboard, we have the KPI charts for Top 5 by Country/Region, by Sold-to Party and by Service Contract. All these queries picking the top 5 entries in the UI layer rather than pushing the query to the database.

e.g. by Service Contract KPI chart is pulling all the contracts in the UI layer and selecting top 5, which is performance intensive because there is huge amount of data transfer to application layer. To avoid this we have to push the Top X query to the backend.

Kindly take this on priority to avoid the performance issues.

h3. Data label colors

The Data labels need to fulfill a contrast of 4.5:1 to their background. Some of our charts have data labels on the bars or other chart components rather than the widget background. Here it needs to be guaranteed, that the label fulfills the contrast ratio. 
* For the standard palette the horizon morning standard label color (#1D2D3E) fulfills the background and can be used.
* For charts using the continuous palette, the  label color needs to be inverted to white (#FFFFFF).
* For charts using the sequential palette, data labels on the chart components sometimes need to be white (#FFFFFF), sometimes the default horizon morning label color (#1D2D3E). In the screenshot below it is shown when the white label needs to be used. This could be done with a less contrast statement for instance.

As a planner, I want to do a reverse calculation from the SubTotal or %SubTotal to the individual members of the measure. For this, it should be possible to make data entries at the SubTotal and %SubTotal level.
 * {*}Data entry at SubTotal level{*}: the new amount resulted from the data entry should be disaggregated to the individual members following the disaggregation behavior driven by the measure's aggregation mode.
 * {*}Data entry %SubTotal level{*}: once the weight of one member is adjusted, the delta should be added to or substracted from the other individual members that belong to the SubTotal to ensure the subtotal absolute value stays at the same.??

If any of the dimension members is locked, it should be excluded from the data disaggregation/spread.????

SubTotals should also consider hierarchies.??

+*Data entry at SubTotal level*+

{{*Example 1*}}

Sales is a Measure defined with aggregation mode = sum. Sales values are booked across 5 product groups that belong to 2 different regions, generating a SubTotal of 30 for Region North and 40 for Region South.??

_*Before data entry:*_
|Region|Product|Sales|SubTotal for Region|Grand Total|
|North|Alcohol|*10*|*30*??|70|
|??|Carbonated Drinks|*20*|*30*|70|
|South|Alcohol|10|40|70|
|??|Carbonated Drinks|10|40|70|
|??|Energizers|20|40|70|

As a Sales Manager I want to double the Sales numbers for Region North, from 30 to 60. I should be able to edit the data in any of the SubTotal cells corresponding to North.????

_*After data entry:*_??

As a result of the data entry, the SubTotal new value is 60 having the following proportional distribution:
 * North 1 increases from 10 to 20
 * North 2 increases from 20 to 40

The Grand Total is also updated to reflect the new total, 100.??
|Region|Product|Sales|SubTotal for Region|Grand Total|
|North|Alcohol|*20*|*60*|*100*|
|??|Carbonated Drinks|*40*|*60*|*100*|
|South|Alcohol|10|40|*100*|
|??|Carbonated Drinks|10|40|*100*|
|??|Energizers|20|40|*100*|

{{*Example 2*??}}

_*Before data entry:*_

Location has Hierarchy with Region (e.g. North) as parent and child as different Sub-Regions (e.g. North 1). In the below example, we can edit subtotals for the Location dimension hierarchies.
|Location|Product|Sales|Subtotals|%Subtotals|

As a Sales Manager I want to double the subtotal of the North Region to reflect a very successful trade strategy. I enter 82 for the Subtotal of the North location. Entering it in any of the rows corresponding to North, e.g. Alcohol, will automatically reflect it for the remaining rows, e.g. Carbonated Drinks.{*}{{*}}??_**_??

_*After data entry:*_

As a result, the Subtotal value is proportionally disaggregated to the product Alcohol and Carbonated Drinks categories, and then to the Sub-regions North1 and North2.??

|North|Alcohol|*28*|*82*|34%|

*Data entry at %SubTotal level*

{{*Example 1*}}

*Before data entry:*??

For each location, the %SubTotal is calculated to indicate the Product Weight to the Region's total.??
|Region|Product|Sales|SubTotal for Region|%SubTotal for Region|Grand Total|%GrandTotal|
|North|Alcohol|20|60|33,3%|100|20%|

|??|Carbonated Drinks|10|40|25%|100|10%|
|??|Energizers|20|40|50%|100|20%|

*After data entry:*

As a Sales Manager, I want to change the weight distribution of Alcohol drinks from 25% to 40%.?? As a result, the other Products weight should be reduced by 15% to ensure the SubTotal absolute value remains the same.??
 * Carbonated Drinks decreases from 25% to 10%
 * Energizers decreases from 50% to 40%

|Region|Product|Sales|SubTotal for Region|%SubTotal for Region|Grand Total|%GrandTotal|
|North|Alcohol|20|60|33,3%|100|20%|

|??|Energizers|*16*|40|*40%*|100|*16%*|

??

*Authorizations Requirements*??

*Limitations:*??
 * Simultaneous data entry at SubTotal and individual member level??

*Open questions for Alecs to check:*
 * Should the weights% of the other regions automatically adjust proportionally or should the user be required to input the desired weights through an error message? In S/4 Universal Allocation the Weight/Percentage of one member does not automatically trigger a readjustment of the others, but the user is required to keep the Total Balance to 100%.??

?? ?? ?? ?? ??  !image-2022-03-04-11-33-57-335.png|width=745,height=405!
 * For %SubTotal how do we handle discrete numbers? e.g. 1% might lead to 0.5 units which does not make sense.??
 * Check for aggregation modes different than sum

The scope is to do this for Story 2.0 toolbars, menus and dialogs. As we will only be able to deliver this for the embedding scenarios, components that are only available in enterprise and not embedded are out of scope.

As story 2.0 can be consumed in the lightweight viewer as well, it is also required that the lightweight viewer toolbars fully support horizon themes.

Support for horizon themes was committed to S/4 and is planned to be delivered with story 2.0 in H1 2023. The upgrade to horizon can be started after an upgrade of UI5 planned for the early waves of Q1 2023.

We therefore need to support the specific styling options required for fiori as part of our theming solution and as widget settings. It is defined in detail where a setting needs to be available (theme preferences and/or CSS and potentially widget styling) 

The canvas theming has to be supported with story 2.0 and it needs to be possible to consume the themes in Lightweight Viewer as well. Lightweight viewer needs to support the same concepts as story 2.0 (e.g. applying a theme with URL parameter.)

The requirements are derived from a gap analysis and aim at closing the biggest gaps and to get close to the Horizon look and feel. Some small deviations from the defined Horizon look will not be closed.

Additionally we need to make sure that the default proposed colors are aligned with the fiori horizon morning and evening colors. 

The work is split up into four larger areas
* Creating the themes in SAC and shipping them to all enterprise tenants
* Delivering styling option enhancements necessary to make the themes work for OEM scenarios (reduced scope as  only certain widgets are available in the embedding scenrios)
* Delivering styling option enhancements to make themes work for the enterprise scope (all widgets of story 2.0 need to have sufficient styling options to show up in Horizon)
* Ensuring that Canvas Theming works also for the lightweight viewer.


Another work stream is aimed at enabling the horizon themes for the toolbar and the rest of the application.

It means the API is 'missing' this access right and to assign/change/unassign this right requires the user interface unlike all other rights

So this Enhancement is for this DELETE COMMENT to be added as an 'access' 
Its needed because without this admins have to use the User Interface when for all other rights they do not. It means admins have a lot of manual effort which is prone to human error.

This is especially important in applications catering to service scenarios, where there are multiple use cases to calculate the difference between any two date/time fields upto a granularity of hours, minutes and even seconds, for example to time taken for initial response to a customer ticket, time taken for ticket resolution etc. This is crucial to measure adherence to SLAs in many businesses. Also, it is important to introduce this calculation in the SAC story calculation editor, as that can also be applicable for embedded SAC use cases who do not have access to standard SAC modeler.

Currently, in SAC it is only possible to calculate the difference between Date between (days between two fields) and not with date and time.

*What already works?*

Today, SAC has DateDiff calculation that works for HANA live connectivity, however this works only if the dimension if of type date and the difference can be found up till ""day"" level granularity.

This also works for embedded SAC tenant in applications like C4C, using {+}extended HANA live connectivity{+}.

!screenshot-1.png|thumbnail!

*What does not work?*

SAC Enterprise customers as well as SAC embedded customers (that include applications like C4C and many other LOB applications that are on HANA Cloud today) have important dimensions - date/time fields stored as timestamps (i.e. both date and time Ex: ticket creation, ticket initial response, ticket resolution, etc).

A very common KPI for them is to calculate the response times, which means difference calculation between two timestamps. This cannot be done today in SAC for following reasons:
 * DateDiff calculation does not support timestamp dimensions,
 * DateDiff does not support hour, minutes and seconds for granularity.

Although un-related, it should be noted that for the embedded SAC usecase, timestamps are not available as hierarchy in embedded SAC, specifically with extended HANA live connectivity.

Hence, As a report designer for SAC, I should be able to create a calculation that provides difference between two date/time (timestamp) fields.

*Priority*

This need to be given very high priority because in the context of Customer Service related business process, datetime based KPI analysis is very important. For example to check the SLA compliance related to initial response time (it could be in minutes or hours. Not in days).

This is also a highly voted for requirement from SAC Enterprise customers as can be seen in this influence request: [https://influence.sap.com/sap/ino/#/idea/258836]
Customers who have voted for such a requirement include:
 * Business Connexion (Pty) Ltd
 * Cargolux Airlines International SA
 * Catigo Analytics AB
 * Cubis Solutions BV
 * ERCROS, S.A.
 * EnBW Energie Baden-W??rttemberg AG
 * GERMANS BOADA, S.A.
 * HI PARTNERS HOLDCO VALUE ADDED SA
 * JSC ""SAPRUN GROUP""
 * Logis GmbH
 * Lufthansa Technik AG
 * One World Technologies, Inc.
 * RINEDATA LIMITED
 * SAP
 * SEIDOR CONSULTING, S.L.

Also, in case of embedded SAC customers like C4C where embedded SAC is estimated to be used by over 2500 customers, C4C's current (not SAC) analytics solution allows users to calculate time difference between two time dimensions. A similar functionality is needed for SAC embedded in C4C. In the new C4C Service Cloud context, since C4C are relying only on SAC OEM (as they have not developed any alternative analytics offering in their new cloud native stack), lack of datetime difference calculation will be treated as a critical business feature limitation. Hence this is very important for CX Service Cloud use case perspective.

*In Scope*

Relevant for SAC enterprise and all LOB applications that use HANA Cloud today.",1,1

Currently threshold styling is defined on story/application level. The colors and symbols are assigned on story level. The style used for a table can be assigned in the story preferences or per table.

It is not possible to change the symbol, assigned color or display style (for table) at theme level (either in the theme preferences or CSS).

This feature is necessary for Q1 QRC to make accessibility theming work as we cannot fulfill the 7:1 contrast to black and white background with one set of colors per threshold.

Possible solution:
- define thresholds in story as today including style; name functions as ID or add an additional ID
- define a set of threshold styles in theme preferences including an ID
- pull threshold style from theme if the ID exists in the theme, pull from story defined style if ID is not available as part of a theme

The way comments are stored outside of the model with links only to Filter and DAC is making browsing comments for users complex. The expectation is that comments can be ""browsed"" throughout the model.

Main gaps:
 * 
 ## Hierarchies are not acknowledged. A user expects with a selected parent the comments below the parent are also visible
 ## Comments should always be associated with the data, if no dimension member has been assigned # should be default
 ## Input control for version functions as AND filter now, thus not showing any comments with selection, version filter input control is needed for comment widget.
 ## Ideally when comments in the widget are selected, the data associated in the story should be highlighted.
 ## Datapoint classification, thus that there is a filter option for ""chit chat"" and ""company Guidance"" for example, including who has the rights to add a given classification
 * Fixing 1 and 2 is also a pre req for exports to work as customers would expect.

Problem Statement:

Currently there's no option to sync master data created in SAP BW, directly into SAC. These master data dimensions have to created manually and synced manually.

Clarification:

BPC embedded leverages Master data from BW system(no duplication) for building the model.??
However for SAC Planning, Google need to import the Dimension Master data into SAC or create private dimensions(duplicate data), with this process there is always sync issues and inconsistent master data and also due to this, Google faced recent challenges in linking dimensions from Live connections to Acquired connections model.
If Google have to migrate from BPC to SAC, without this feature, they have to build a lot of master data pipelines and lot of efforts for maintenance
??
What's the ask?
Similar to how BPC leverage master data from BW, can SAC be improvised to refer the meta data(master data) from BW live for the Acquired connections model.
This sort of similar feature is available in SAP BPC optimized for S/4 product, where BPC leverages master data from S/4 based on views concept.

Weighted Average Calcuataion/Input,FPA34-7798,12934166,User Story,Open,FPA34,Medium,I818705,I818705,I818705,7/27/2022 17:24,7/29/2022 21:24,9/29/2022 10:02,,,,Modeling ,"Planning (Allocations, VDT, etc.)",,,,,,"With our current calculation/inversion formula paradigm we lack an easy way to handle price input as well as correct average price aggregation on a single account/measure.?? ??

??

There are two principal scenarios here:

??

1) Input of price and calculation of average price - In the case of input of price, quantity, and sales (or some combination of similar),both quality and sales both need to use a sum aggregation or exception aggregation, however the price for aggregation needs to be averaged.?? ??This can only be accomplished by setting the formula itself on the price member, and deriving sales and quantity from that.?? ??This is problematic for two reasons (which also related directly to item #2)

?? ?? ?? ?? ?? A) it assumes quantity or sales is entered first otherwise you will get a div by zero error

?? ?? ?? ?? ?? B) it results in a counter intuitive?? input experience for price at an aggregation level (i.e. users expect average?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ??price to be disaggregated, however because of the inversion formula, sales or quantity is at the aggregate?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ??level, and derived and that is the value that is disaggregated

??

2) Assuming #1 is handled correct (i.e. ability to input price at a leaf level, but calculated weighted average price at an aggregate), some customers would like to treat the weighted average price calculation as an average calculation for input (i.e., they would like to enter an average price at the parent and have that automatically replicated at all relevant leaves).?? Of course this can occur where the price member does not have a formula, and where average exception aggregation is used on the price member.?? ??This issue with this is that it's a misrepresentation of what average price is from a reporting perspective (i.e., it is not a weighted average price.

When a story is first created, the default is set for all three. The default is the side by side bars, the solid pattern and a color from the assigned palette.  When a change is made, the color and pattern change but the state of the setting goes from initial or default to custom. That means, the color is now hard coded and no longer pulled from the palette. 

The setting cannot be reset to pull colors from the color palette and there is no workaround like deleting the chart or the model from the story.

Additional Requirement:

Requirement from Siemens in the direction of managing private bookmarks:

_we are asking for a development, that gives the user an option to delete bookmarks from their list that have been shared with them by other users. At the moment, the bookmark can only be unshared by the user who shared the bookmark. The user who got the bookmark shared with has no option to remove it from his/her bookmarks list. So it is not about deleting a bookmark from another owner/user but simply to be able to hide this from your list (because maybe it was a faulty one or you don?€?t even have the authorizations to open the bookmark)._??

_We also don?€?t want to use global bookmarks because we want to avoid a huge mess of bookmarks in the tool visible to all users. If everyone is able to see all bookmarks from other users, the list also gets huge & confusing (also to people who are only using 1-2 bookmarks each month).?€?_

I understand what they are referring to and I can also understand that this could be a mess when they have a lot of users working with the dashboards. What do you think?

There are 2 implementation steps for this request: (1) Quick-win: There should be a possibility to completely hide the Story-Filter Icon in Viewer mode for critical stories (see attachment). (2) There should be a possibility to hide/customize specific dimensions that can be used a Story-Filter in Viewer mode (see attachment). This request is a re-submission of #Request ID: 227070

Problem: Some dimensions are required in the data source but should not be available for filtering purposes. Example: The Currency dimension is required in the data source to be able to add a dynamic text to show the currency of the display

Benefit: What is the expected benefit? Better overview of available dimensions when user adds a story filter in the Viewer mode. Avoid situations where a user can get more information as intended by the story designer (need-to-know principle).

As a modeler, I would like to be able to see an infobox in the conditional formatting section of SAC. This infobox should display a message reminding me to individually turn on thresholds on each widget respectively. Please find an example of how this might look like attached.

??

??

Business Scenario / Example


In my specific case I struggled a long time to find out why one of my thresholds was not displayed at all in a widget. I have checked and adjusted the threshold multiply times and have even redone the SAC page, because I figured surely a bug is the reason why this threshold does not show up on one of the measures, as I have created the threshold correctly and did no mistakes there (a colleague confirmed this). I could only resolve this issue after consulting an experienced colleague who has struggled with the same problem in the past. Overall, not knowing that you had to turn on individual thresholds on widgets has cost me a lot of time.

Value added??

When adding thresholds to stories this feature would assure quality and consistency in stories, as modelers will be reminded to check each widget for a correct display of thresholds. Further, a lot of time could be saved, as colleagues would spend a lot of time looking to solve this problem.",1,1

??

I'm creating this ticket because I haven't found any answers regarding how to change the number scale according to filter applied on the story. I have an SAC story in which I track the amount of ACV of our S/4HANA Cloud business. With the new deals from June, the total ACV is now higher than 1 billion:

!image-2022-07-05-11-31-11-901.png|width=844,height=255!

However, if I apply filters to the story selecting only a portion of it, the number should go down to Million Scale accordingly. However, it doesn't change and shows as 1.13 Billion:

!image-2022-07-05-11-32-45-858.png|width=847,height=255!

??

Also, the 'Average Deal Size' is a calculation that should follow the same logic. I found some posts on the SAC Community and they all say this is something SAC doesn't do automatically... which doesn't make any sense. Can you please check?

Using the persisted values to generate multiple accuracy measures betond MAPE which can be implemented using advanced formulas

In Predictive Scenarios we have to select the forecasting level/combinations on which calculations are done via the entities selection. After the entities are selected, we can filter on them. Filters can only placed on selected dimensions/dimension attributes. It is not possible to select a dimension/attribute as a filter which is not part of the entities selection. We would like to have the possibilitie to place filters on dimensions which are not part of the entites list. (General filter for the data to be conisdered in the forecasting)

_What is the opportunity/problem the request_??_will address?_

There are to main problems. First, we have to include dimensions/attributes into the entities only for enable filtering on this dimension, which will increase the complexity of the forecasting granularity unnecessary (as we have more entities selected then really needed). Second, the list of entities is limited to 5. So we cannot have more than 5 filters. If more filters are needed, we would have to add preprocessing to the general process of forecasting via data actions and maybee even a seperate model, just for filtering/preprocessing. In total it will increase cost/effort for customers which is against the goal of SAC being a simple to use product for the end user.

In the screeshots attached you can see we have selected 5 entities. Only 2 are needed for the forecasting: Company Code and Material. The other 3 entities are only used as filters.

_What is the expected benefit?_

Avoid extra complexity for seperate pre processing steps and additional objects due to lack of simple filter possibilities in Predictive Scenarios.",1,1

There are cases when the conversion depends on the object for which the conversion is required. For example, the conversion from piece to pallet depends on the product used to build the pallet.

As you can see below, depending on the Product, we will have a different conversion ratio from Piece to Pallet.??
|*Product**|*Target UoM**|*Numerator*|*Denominator*|
|*Bottle 0.5l*|*PALLET*|1|48|
|*Bottle 1l*|*PALLET*|1|24|

To solve this dependency, the requirement is to enable the unit of measurement Conversion dependent on a selected dimension, in addition to the central unit of measure table.

(In S/4HANA the unit of measure conversion for materials is defined in the MARM table)

??*Requirements:*

Assuming we have a model with two generic dimensions: PRODUCT and RESOURCE, the unit of measure conversion could be required to be specific to any of these dimensions.??

One unit of measure conversion table per dimension should be sufficient.??

Creation/maintenance:??**??

When the table is created for the first time, I expect a pop-up asking to specify for which dimension the unit of measure conversion item dependent table should be generated.??
1. ?? ??The first step should be the selection of the dimension for which the Unit of Measurement Conversion is desired.
2. ?? ??Once the Dimension is selected, the table should be generated.??
3. ?? ??The first column should require the maintenance of the dimension members, and it should include a value help with the members that belong to the dimension selected in Step1.??
4. ?? ??The following columns should include information on the target UoM, conversion factors and any additional required fields for the conversion.
5. ?? ??The conversion should always happen from the base unit of measure, which should be a property defined at the dimension id level.??

Ideally, the creation of the dimension dependent unit of measure conversion could also be triggered from the dimension member id. e.g., If I add a new member to the Product Dimension, I would like to maintain the alternative Unit of Measures and the conversion factors directly from the Dimension table. I expect to have the ability to open a new window and maintain this additional info.??
 * The unit of measure conversion should work for both stored and calculated measures.
 * Admin users should easily define through configuration at the measure level whether a unit of measure conversion should be applied or not. When a unit of measure should be applied, the user should select from a value help the desired unit of measure type.??
 * *If a dependent unit of measure if not found for a member, there should be a fallback mechanism on the standard table.*",1,1

Table and Analysis Reports cannot be used without a proper filtering functionality.
 * it is more convenient, if I see less dimension attributes (If I e.g. have to pick ""Sales Order by ID"" there might be more than 100.000 dimension attributes in a table report. If I filter on Status=Open, there might only be 10.000. If I continue filtering on Creation Date = Current Year, there might reduced to 5.000. If I filter on Owned by ""Sales Person XYZ"" It might filter only 25.
 * It is confusing, if the filter shows elements without any effect. If I Filter on Open, but still see all active dates and filter e.g. for 2012 and will get no result, the user will not see anything

In BEx, even with ""Universal Hierarchy Display"" turned on, we can still choose to expand hierarchy to a certain level. In Compact Display mode, the table axis is represented by a fictive dimension ""1DG_2"" and getSelection() on the table axis returns values that cannot be used.

The challenge to update artefacts (stories, applications) when multiple updates are needed. The problem is amplified when multiple updates are needed by different teams and when the same artefacts has needed urgent updates outside of the normal life-cycle development to fix a production related issue, but before the normal development cycle was completed. Thus, it?€?s a real challenge to ensure that any regular development updates are not made to overwrite other updates made by different teams. The different teams exist because there?€?s a need to ?€?correct?€? current issues, and well as enhance additional features and these need to be done in parallel. 


To enable the support of both correcting artefacts and the development of new features of SAP Analytics Cloud artefacts (mostly stories and applications) without the need to stop one to allow the other. It will also reduce the fear of overwriting and losing the development effort made by teams working on the same content in parallel. Today, the development of artefacts doesn?€?t allow multiple ?€?tracks?€? of development and this feature would start to allow this to happen and thus unlock the business from development freezes so to avoid regression.

In this case, any validation rule constraining what members of reference dimension ""dim A"" can be combined with what members of the MATCHED dimension, let's call it ""dim B"" is NOT RELEVANT as the usage of ""# - Unassigned member"" of dim A means that we don't care about dim A for the current key figure. So why applying the validation rule in this case ? In this case, we should be able to easily tell to SAC that ""# - Unassigned member"" of dim A (reference dimension) can be used with all members of dim B (MATCHED dimension). The current behavior of SAC authorizes ""# - Unassigned member"" of dim A (reference dimension) ONLY to be combined with dim B members (MATCHED dimension members) that are valid with the other members of dim A !

[Filter Across Models] Ability to choose whether indirect filtering should be applied,FPA34-7717,12579986,User Story,Open,FPA34,Medium,I514333,I514333,I514333,6/14/2022 22:03,6/14/2022 22:08,9/29/2022 10:02,,,,"BI (Charts, Explorer, Geo, Input controls, etc.)",,,,,,,"Option to control indirect filtering when filters on un-linked dimensions are provided in a Story with multiple linked dimensions.

_Usecase_

Two models (Model A & Model B) are linked based on a Dimension (Dim X) and when a filter is applied based on Model A-Dim Y dimension, by default an indirect filter is applied to Model B resulting in long running query on Model B in the back-end even though Dim Y is not part of linked dimensions. User should have an option to enable or disable indirect filtering as not in all cases we might need Model B to be filtered using un-linked dimensions.

Concrete Example:

Story A consists of two pages. Page 1 shows HR data, Page 2 shows Sales data.
The customer wants to have Region (which is a common dimension in both models) as Story Filter and leverage link dimension to have a single selection for both.
Creating Input Controls for e.g. Products (which are just part of the sales model) will create indirect filter & decrease performance, while it is useless in that case.



_What is the expected benefit?_

??Ability to optimize queries depending on the use case if an option to enable/disable indirect filtering is provided.",1,1

You can see there is NO way to determine who the parent of PD1 is.

It means the export data API has a limited use-case, it can really only be used to export actual data and not its dimension data, since dimension data without any hierarchy is not complete and thus means its unreliable and requires manual re-work to any changes made in SAC. It means the export data API, even when used with an SAP connector (like DWC or HANA) requires extra manual work and/or unsupported 'adjustments' in the target systems.

The response time and CPU time in the case of scenario 2 execution were faster compared to scenario 1, after applying widget level on same the dimension used in RKF. This proves the filter push down on semantic tag dimension gets applied after applying widget level filter and not happening in RKF.

BW Variables should also show ID if set in the query as standard behaviour (it is actually ignored) or have a setting for this in SAC designer. Story filter on variable always show text and user always has to switch it manually even though BW query has key setting applied.

_What is the opportunity/problem the request_??_will address?_

Usability of variables is very bad, as there are long texts in the filters and not the ID.

_What is the expected benefit?_

Shorter filters and also important information in the filters (like Fiscyear or very simple an account number).

When using properties on a Version dimension, and users want to create a new version they need to go through a heavy manual process: 1) Open up a story, with a table connected to the planning model 2) Go into Version Management Panel 3) Copy an existing version to a Private Version 4) Publish the Private Version 5) Go into Files Area to find the planning model 6) Open the model 7) Open the Version dimension 8) Add property values to the newly created version 9) If Data Acccess Control is enabled on the Version dimension, add respective teams that use the new version to Read/Write columns 10) Repeat entire above process for every planning model where the same version is needed This is unmanageable.

Where different types of forecast / plan etc. have different submission requirements, it is not currently possible to use validation rules, since they apply globally to all versions / time periods. For example, you may wish to limit the dimension combinations used for a high level quick forecast, whereas a detailed bottom up budget would not require the same restrictions. In this scenario, validation rules can't be used to enforce the summary level inputs in the quick forecast, because they would also apply to other versions such as the budget. A similar limitation exists where valid dimension member combinations might change over time, e.g. member A is associated with member B up to Dec 2020, but associated with member C from Jan 2021 onwards. Validation rules could not be used here, since they to apply to all time periods. What is the expected benefit?

We&rsquo;re searching for a solution like BPC BPF. When the user submit the task, the access for attached files should be limited. To use data locking task correctly, our driving dimensions should be cost center, gl_account, time and version and it is too hard to manage. Admin user should know every responsible user who will be assigned for related granularity. It means a process(input task + data locking task) should be created for each user. It means hundreds of input task+data locking task have to be managed. Additionally, owner has to select assignee one by one. We created teams for each story. We need to able to select team to assign the task ( because we have more than 1000 users) and we need to follow process user by user individually. We have lots of users and stories. That is why we need more feasible solution. We already have data access feature for dimensions and it is a good solution to hide the related file for the user who pushed the &ldquo;Submit&rdquo; button. If a user is able to change the input data after it is submitted, it means they are able to change the input data even it is approved by the reviewer. That is not preferred case. Customer wants to lock the data after it is submitted. Even if the work file is not accessible via task anymore, it is still available via file repository. So, it should be closed to change data even the file repository. As a result, we can summarize the requirement as below ; If a user has no open task for a specific template, this template should be closed to change for this user even from task or file repository. It should not be closed read the data, it should be closed to change the data. Best Regards Link to request: https://influence.sap.com/sap/ino/#/idea/238364",1,1

Ideally, you would be able to use some special value like ""&lt;any&gt;"" or ""&lt;all&gt;"" or a wildcard symbol to allow any member in the validated/connected dimension. Currently to do this, you would have to fill out the property of the first dimension with a comma separated list containing all members of the second dimension (e.g. member1,member2,member3.....) and this is not practical. To describe this slightly differently, we need a special value in a property to allow us to turn off validation rules for certain members. Therefore all combinations would be allowed, and effectively validation rules are turned off for certain members. What is the opportunity/problem the request will address? Here is an example use case: A cost center belongs to a profit center, but a profit center does not need to have data in a cost center (example: balance sheet data, revenue data). Current in the validation rules, you can tie a cost center to a specific cost center, but you are not able to allow cost center: unassigned to post to any profit center. The # cost center needs flagged with a * or &lt;all&gt; or &lt;any&gt; or some special value to will allow data in cost center # to be populated into any member of the profit center dimension. Here is another: A profit center belongs to a company code, but a company code does not need to have data in a profit center. Current in the validation rules, you can tie a profit center to a specific company code, but you are not able to allow profit center: unassigned to post to any company code. The # profit center needs flagged with a * or &lt;all&gt; or &lt;any&gt; or some special value to will allow data in profit center # to be populated into any member of the profit center dimension.

This will allow SAC validation rules to be better utilized in line with the structure of the data that most customers load from an S/4 source systems (Finance / Controlling). From a reporting standpoint, this will improve data quality by removing invalid combinations of dimensions as this functionality intends. From a planning standpoint, it will allow us to input data by a certain dimension (such as cost center) without worrying about whether it goes to the proper members of related dimension (company code, profit center).

This would also be the case for BW live data being consumed through the BW bridge.

But what if the customer is bypassing the bridge and consuming their BW queries directly in SAC; bypassing the bridge layer?

The idea behind this user story is to now even bother trying to blend BW live sources in the data suite, but rather take the same approach as Analysis Office when blending data with BW queries; use BW workspaces. Rather than pushing on-prem data up to the cloud and blending there, we push the cloud data down into the on-prem BW workspace and join it there.

We could potentially use the same APIs as AO and the Netweaver Business Client to save effort and create a more modern and user friendly UX alternative to the Business Client.

Improve SAC Application Startup Time for Slower Clients,FPA34-7624,12264485,Backlog Item,Open,FPA34,Medium,,D049609,D049609,5/3/2022 15:07,5/3/2022 15:10,9/29/2022 10:03,,,,,,,,,,,"Dear colleagues,

as requested, I'm creating this request on behalf of the Bosch escalation team:

The customer uses links to open SAC Stories and Analytic Applications via URL from external pages. They are not happy with the loading performance of the content.

During the RCA of the Global Escalation, they noticed a large amount of JavaScript files and are particularly concerned about the SAC application startup runtime, i.e. the time until we start loading the actual story/application. This runtime depends very much on the client resources (CPU) and differ a lot. The regular business user does not have a high end laptop. Hence, the user faces longer runtimes. The team tested the browser benchmark scores (captured via https://browserbench.org/Speedometer2.0/) and found large differences between Bosch end user and SAP clients.

The customer shared 3 trace files for loading a simple application. I have uploaded them here: [Trace Files on OneDrive Share|https://sap-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/p/christian_schoenbein/EptbyZGaM8BCvMPOqXznoXEB-LHR_0JXHw4WSG8PZxRXwg?e=PbVHKz].

Unfortunately, we do not have RAPTR traces. So, I will use the contentlib request fetching the story content as the one relevant to the start of loading of the story/application content. 
# The fast case: We start loading the contentlib after 7.79s.
# The slow case: We start loading the contentlib after 10.59s.

Both scenarios have been captured with a warm cache and only few kB have been transferred. The CPU resources seem to have a rather large impact on this loading time.

The customer expectation would be to be able to open a story/application without having to wait for that long to start rendering the story/application content.

Best regards,
Christian

_What is the opportunity/problem the request_??_will address?_

Simple Example:

There is a story filter, which has 5 values ({_}A{_},??{_}B{_},??{_}C{_},??{_}D{_},??{_}E{_}). Due to Cascading Effect, the user only sees the following filter entries if the filter is opened.
 * [X]??_All_
 * [X]??_A_
 * [X]??_B_

*Case 1:*??The user only wants to see??_B_??and goes the ""shortest way""; B is deselected. This results in the following view:
 * [?? ]??_All_
 * [?? ]??_A_
 * [X]??_B_

However, the actual selection result is??{_}B{_},??{_}C{_},??{_}D{_},??_E_??because the ""inactive values"" are kept selected, too.

*Case 2:*??If the user would first deselect??_All_??and then select??{_}B{_}, the result looks the same (looking at the dropdown:
 * [?? ]??_All_
 * [?? ]??_A_
 * [X]??_B_

In this case, the actual result is only??{_}B{_}.

=> The selection in the LOV looks the same both times, but the result is different.

The idea of having the new option active would be that in Case 1 also only the visible values are selected as the actual results. So that the visible selection corresponds to the actual selection.

Having that option available would prevent confusion for the users. The behavior of the filters would not differ anymore from other tools they use (e.g. Excel...).",1,1

Now if we need to display Selected Month in the report tile using a dynamic text and refer to story filter, it shows the incorrect value from a user's perspective.??

??

For example, the financial year is 20-21. According to SAC, APR (20-21) is APR 20 For Jan (20-21) it's Jan 20. (But from a calendar Month perspective it's Jan 21). In the dynamic text, it displays as Jan 20. Which misleads the user. I agree that technically SAC is doing the right things as it's just showing what's selected story filter. But there has to be an option to show the correct month and year to the end user in the report title.??

??

The customer decides to scrap the solution just because of this reason as the business impact is huge as they cannot show a report which shows that Sales report for Jan 20 but actually the report is for Jan 21.??",1,1

Story filter new behavior in linked analysis,FPA34-7593,12179712,User Story,Open,FPA34,Medium,I866445,I552747,I552747,4/20/2022 20:18,4/20/2022 20:18,9/29/2022 10:03,,,,,,,,,,,"Hello,
Today when selecting a local filter on a chart/table (defined as Story wide through linked analysis), SAC creates a story filter and a local filter. Removing this story filter doesn?€?t remove its corresponding local filter. ??This has a big impact on the visibility and readability of the charts: ?€?Reset of the story"" in the edit is only a workaround. We expect the local filter to be removed once its corresponding story is deleted (the reverse is true). This behavior has been rejected by the SAP support team, that is why we are creating an improvement ([https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#incident/pointer/002075129400003014532021])

Reproducer
 * select a local filter (with linked analysis on Story filter) on a given chart,
 * the filter is correctly applied to the story and is visible in the story bar,
 * a local filter is also created in the chart,
 * then remove the filter from the story bar
 * ??==> all the charts apply the removal of the filter,
 * *Except the chart where the filter has been created, the local filter is still active.*

The requested improvement here is the capability to select graphically from any chart a story filter, and be able to remove it from the story bar, including the local filter ?€? In two words, when selecting a local filter (on a widget) where the linked analysis is story wide, we don?€?t want the local filer to be created.

Amadeus is moving a lot of SAP financial dashboards created on Qlik to SAC, and we expect to have the same behavior as in Qlik, this time in SAC. 99% of the behaviors, if not 100%, are Story filtering. Without this being implemented, filtering and navigation in a SAC story could lead to some confusion as the chart may not display what is expected, and this deeply impacts our management reporting.

Thanks for your help and Support,

Here is the scenario,

e.g. we have multiple numeric point charts using the same key figure or measure, each chart has its own static filter applied with different values, and all these charts have Linked Analysis to cross tab.

In this kind of use case, we should not have two clicks on the same widget (one for apply filter and the second click for clear filter) before clicking on the next chart. Once we clicked on the second numeric chart it should reset the first filter (if the filter has already been applied) and apply only the second filter.

The two clicks on the same chart lead to a confusion for users and it is not the standard way the user used their analytics in the past in other analytics tools??

We would need, e.g. in the case of linked analysis, one-click should filter the data and the next click to another widget should clear existing filter and apply new relevant filter.

Might be this change also a problem for cascading linking, So SAP should provide an option to make the choice of cascading or not. So based on that filter selection should behave

The dynamic text is widely used to give context to a report. However, the capabilities are limited. Can we have a formula-based dynamic text???

For example, I can link it with story filter selection. But lets I want to do some more processing to it before displaying it.??

One of the scenarios could be a story filter is returning Financial Year selection, Jan 21 based on a financial year enabled model with the start of the year to denote the Year. Now in the report to give an actual context to the user, I would like to manipulate the selection string to make it Jan 22.

In Webi, the user response function returns the selection made by the user, and then I can further process it by webi formula. So in the above example, I can covert the date string above to date using todate and then add 1 year and format it back to month and year and display it.??

This is very critical when SAC is getting projected as a tool for enterprise reporting where the user would need a lot more text to show the context based on the input made on the screen.

For countries that follow the calendar year as a financial year (starting from Jan), there is not much impact as the representation doesn't confuse the year.

So I am proposing the following feature for Input Control. For discussion let's use Product Dimension with a property Material Type (Finished Goods, and Semi-Finished Goods). Here I want to provide an input control to show only with Material Type Semi Finish Goods.??

So while creating/designing the Input Control, let the user choose the dimension/property and then give an additional option to restrict the LOV with the following options:

By Property. Here allow the user to choose by Material Type and list the property values and let him choose one or more property values.??

??

By Story Filter: Let's say I have a story filter that allows the user to choose the material type and I want to filter the Product Input Control based on the material type selected on the Story filter. I should be able to choose a property and then link it with the story filter.??

Similarly, I have a hierarchy node in the story filter on product dimension, I should be able to link the input control to restrict the products based on the node selected on the Story filter.??

From an application designer: I should be able to restrict the input control list of values based on a property/hierarchy node based on a script variable.??

The Improvement would be giving a SAC user with no editing rights, the possibility of selecting what hierarchy to use in a Story Filter

At the moment, when a Story Filter is put in place for a dimension with hierarchies, it is possible to select the hierarchy only at the time of setting up the filter. However, if a normal user with no editing rights wants to use another hierarchy, it is not possible to choose which one to use and the user is limited to what the person who created the story used. For example, if I have two hierarchies for Plant, one being DCs and another National Stores, the user cannot choose which one to use in the filter. If DCs has been used at the time of setting up the Story Filter, the user is not able to choose National Stores.

The benefit would be usability and user experience, simplifying the usage of a hierarchy. If the requirement is for the end-user to be able to choose the hierarchy, a workaround has to be used, either having a page filter (or table) with the dimension or having two variables, one for selecting the hierarchy and another one for the nodes.",1,1

We are using SAC for a critical Month End Closure related process for Charging & Allocations, where we use the allocation functionality in SAC. The data is provided via BPC source

As the solution is critical for MEC, we would like to use a SAC QA environment to test changes.

The SAC QA would be connected to our BPC QA, while the SAC PRD would be connected to our BPC PRD. We would create the model in SAC QA, with the datasource linked to BPC QA. After successful testing, we would like to export-import the model in SAC to SAC PRD (after transporting BPC datasource changes). As the model is initially pointing towards SAC QA, we would like the datasource to be mapped to SAC PRD at import (or via a manual activity).

At this moment, this remapping is not possible, and we need to completely rebuild the model in SAC PRD.

As we have 200 + rules, this takes a lot of time.

This is standard functionality in SAP BW / HANA.",1,1

It would be great to be able to use the type library TimeRange to also create fiscal period time ranges. Currently it is restricted to cal* times only and hence can not be used for setting dimension filters for the date dimension in our model.

TTable_1.getDataSource().setDimensionFilter(""Date"", [{greaterOrEqual: ""[Date].[FYQP].&[202101]""}, {lessOrEqual: ""[Date].[FYQP].&[202105]""}]);

As we are using fiscal periods in our model, we have to create all entities belonging to a fiscal range via custom coding and handing over as array of individual MemberInfo entries.

Since import jobs are meant to import data on a regular basis, we would need a dynamic date to be able to pick up records based on the day the import job is run. We would require the following: Field: 'Valid From' Before or Including 'SYSTEM DATE' Field: 'Valid To' After or Including 'SYSTEM DATE' This is useful for example to filter on price condition records that are valid today.

Today there is no data type DATE for property available.

Today there is no option to add properties into grid for data lock management

With that a usage of past periods variables for locking and validation are needed.

This would reduce manual effort period by period for manual locking of past periods against data changes and help for customer adoption and trust having more automatism

??

*Business Scenario / Example*

As a planner I would like to avoid input readiness for past periods or invalid combinations. For example an employee starts working in August 2022, I want to define a date to validate whether I can include the employee in my monthly forecast or not and for valid periods only.

When editing an import in a new model, on the import settings' ""clean and replace"" scoping, if the version is changed, the import should load to that selected version (it does not). What is the opportunity/problem the request will address? It is not obvious that the ""clean and replace"" scoping for version does not change the mapping of the version dimension in the ""map to target"" step, which is where the mapping actually matters. When a user first creates an import, they are able to select the version on the ""clean and replace"" scoping, which sets the version in the ""map to target"", but when they try to Edit the import later, the ""map to target"" does not update/remap. Only when the map to target is empty does the ""clean and replace"" fill in the blank. It should update the the map to target version each and every time the ""clean and replace"" version is changed. What is the expected benefit? Less error and frustration when importing data. The false conclusion the imports need to be re-created because the version mapping is locked in by a one-time-only selection. This change makes the ""clean and replace"" setting feature more useful.

Link dimensions accross Import model and BW Live model on compounded BW objects,FPA34-7365,11683549,User Story,Considered,FPA34,Medium,D035331,D035331,T_CI,2/17/2022 16:29,4/1/2022 12:15,9/29/2022 10:03,,,,Modeling ,,,,,,,"Description We have been facing challenges when linking dimensions across different types of models (BW Live and Import Models). This was covered in incident 352545 / 2021. The scenario is that some BW queries are not performing good enough to support dashboarding in SAC using live connection. One relatively simple way of handling this issue is to schedule the BW query execution in a SAC import model so that data is prepared before the user is requesting it - really nice feature. For other BW queries/key figures performance is very good and BW Live connection is then the preferred option. When transferring user selections using ""Link dimensions"" across tables/charts using the two different connection types (Live and Import models) issues arise for compunded BW objects. One common example is on the article hierarchy. User might select a main category (BW technical name 0CM_CDT3) in one table and then expect another table to be filtered on the selected main category. In BW the standard object 0CM_CDT3 is compounded to 0CM_HIED. This means that when 0CM_CDT3 is loaded to a import model the value is a concatenation of the values for the two objects, eg AH/R335. Even though main category (0CM_CDT3) is linked between the import model and the live model the selection of AH/R335 cannot be transferred to the live model. The live model is using an internal representation of the value. Here the ""/"" is removed so the internal representation is AHR335. Consequence is that live model is not returning any data when filtered on AH/R335 which very much looks like an error to the user and the developer. A workaround suggested by SAP is to create a calculated dimension on the table using the import model in order to remove the ""/"" and match the internal representation. This can be done using a formula like CONCAT(SPLIT([d/""IMPORT_Y__VMMSD_C01_Q0001_ITSMIK15"":AH_SectorDI_6a342q04t2].[p/ID],""/"" ,1), SPLIT([d/""IMPORT_Y__VMMSD_C01_Q0001_ITSMIK15"":AH_SectorDI_6a342q04t2].[p/ID],""/"" ,2)) The calculated dimension format is then equivalent to the live connection and the value AHR335 can be passed on to the live connection which is filtered accordingly. Figuring out this can take a long time and raising incident to SAP since it looks like an error in SAC. What is the opportunity/problem the request will address? Make SAC handle the translation from internal to external representation in a more smooth way without requiring developement each and every time an import model is to be linked to a live conneciton. One option could be adding the internal representation to the import model automatically or showing this somehow to the user, so the user can understand why the linking is not working. What is the expected benefit? To make it easier and simpler for users and developers to utilize the huge benefits of combining import models and live models and transferring filters.

??

We are supporting Dell for their FP&A Planning project with SAC-P. One of their calculation requirement is to show shared percentage based on Product hierarchy. In their planning tables they need to check five years historical data and one year forecast data. All the 6 years data are sitting in one version for the historical data is generated based on different sources and it may be various for different Forecast/Planning version.

While showing all 6 years data in one table, the GrandTotal will calculate the subtotal for all the years. However, the requirement is to calculate the subtotals and shared percentage on each period. Do we have any plan to enhance the function GrandTotal() to have ability to pass in arguments to let the system separate the totals based on a dimension like Date in this case?

The customer also has the requirement to do adjustment for the shared percentage to get the result affect back to the dollar amount. And because of it, the project team have to achieve it by creating inverse formulas together with GrandTotal() in calculated measures. The Story formulas cannot be leveraged in this case.

??

Any further information you need for the requirement. Please feel free to contact with me.

SAC embedded / respect Connection ID needed for Life-cycle management,FPA34-7489,12044205,User Story,Open,FPA34,Medium,,I049477,I049477,3/31/2022 13:19,3/31/2022 13:22,9/29/2022 10:03,,,,Developer/APIs,,,,,,,"Today with the SAP Analytics Cloud Embedded Edition, it is only possible to add or delete a live connection via the API. It is not possible to amend, or update an existing live connection. Instead, you must delete the connection and create a new one.

However there are very serious failing and flaws with such a design. Since it is critical that an update to connection respects the existing connection ID:
*  ?€?Custom Groups?€? are created within a Story of one environment (dev) and then transported to another (prod). Although the ?€?Custom Groups?€? are stored within the story, they are actually associated to the connection ID. So, if the connection id in the target (prod) is different, then you won?€?t be able to re-use those Custom Groups you created in the source (dev).

Although Custom Groups are currently only available for BW, and although currently SAC Embedded only supports HANA connections, there's a problem just waiting to happen when SAC Embedded needs to support custom groups and maintain the connection ID across the landscape.

* The best practices (as documented and shared by myself) describes how live connections should be managed across the landscape. To cut it short, it requires transporting/promoting the connection from source to target and then updating this (now existing) connection and NOT to create a new connection. This is important because of (Custom Groups above), but also because models relate to connections by ID. If the connections have different ID's then the user has to manually change the relationship to the connection each time the model is transported (and this isn't good practice).

So, this Enhancement Request is to allow the SAP Embedded Edition to UPDATE an existing live connection without the need to delete it, but instead to respect the connection ID already present.

Whilst today there are very few customers using the SAC Embedded Edition, this ER needs to be put onto the roadmap. This JIRA also acts as an early 'heads-up' and should be used to input into further design documents.  It's also advised to seek expert help from those with implementation and cross solution expertise.

I am part of the Ariba Athena team and currently, our team is using SAP HANA, SAP BO, SAC as our Analytical tools. We are using Dropdown to load the name of the customer in SAC Analytical Designer.

In most business cases we have dimension distinct value more than 1000 which is cause a delay in loading the list of dropdown values in the dashboard.

Below is the snippet of code which we wrote in the SAC AD

_{color:#ffab00}var v_cust_name = Table_accountAssignment.getDataSource().getMembers(""_y-q4YMXaEeifyeLqbdsMhw"",2700);{color}_

Data Change Insight results are currently visible in the notification area, a homescreen widget and via API in Analytics Application.

As a user I'd like to analyze the data change insight results in a story as well and put comprehensive analytics on top. Hence, the requirement is to provide an analytical model of the data change insight result in SAC so users can build own stories and analytical apps on top. (cp. Admin Cockpit)

Let me know if you have any questions.

Add dynamic and fixed range imput controls for date dimensions in one single imput control,FPA34-7338,11600828,User Story,Open,FPA34,Medium,I866445,I866445,T_CI,2/8/2022 18:10,2/10/2022 10:45,9/29/2022 10:03,,,,,,,,,,,"Original Request:

We thought that there is highly recommended have the ability to build in one single input control fixed date ranges and dynamic date ranges as one more option in one selector. This, will give us the ability to create for example a filter which allows user to change easily between dynamic predefined input controls such (from 5 days ago until today) with fixed range input controls (from ""pick a date"" to ""pick a date""). Also, the possibility to change the labels for each of the options. Instead having this: We??d like to have : All Yesterday Current Month 30 days 12 months Current Year

Problem: We all have client requirements' and our mission is fulfilled its and improve the user experience on our dashboards, having the ability to include in one single input control fixed and dynamic ranges allows us quickly filter the data for different periods (dynamically for example Month to date) or fixed ranges (from x to y day).

Benefit: Allows us improve the user experience on our dashboards when complex or multiple date filters have to be available.??",1,1

Currently in SAC, the ""export"" and ""apply permission"" features are only available at the ""Story"" level. Need the ability to export as well as apply object permissions at individual ""Page"" level (more granular) within a ""Story""??

Problem: 1> The export capability is only available at the story level. So, even if we made changes to specific pages, we still need to export and migrate the complete story which is quite an overhead from a maintenance perspective. Also, in terms of the readability of code, having smaller chunks of code makes it much more concise. 2> The object-level permissions need to be applied at the ""Story"" level currently, which makes it rigid as it applies to the complete story irrespective of the number of pages it contains. This prevents sharing individual ""Pages"" to different user groups within a story. Having this at the ""Page"" level makes it more collaborative. Moreover, both the above items are basic features available in any reporting tool which is lacking in SAC.

Benefit: With the above two enhancements, it provides the ability to manage the objects at a more granular level (page) than the current state which makes it more efficient from a maintenance perspective. It also provides the ability to share and control the permissions at the ""Page"" level rather than the ""Story"" level making it much more collaborative. Please let us know if you need more details.

* request body contains the userName (no user id can be specified)
resulting in a new user being created with the:
* response body containing the userid and the userName

If the SAML SSO is set for mapping on email, the userid is derived from the email address.
If the SAML SSO is set for mapping on userid, the userid is the same as the userName.
If the SAML SSO is set for mapping on custom, the userid is the derived from the userName (but not necessarily matching it).

This behaviour causes a problem because there are times customers want to create a user with a userid different from the userName. This typically happens when performing SAML SSO is set for mapping on custom. In such cases you could well want:
SAC userid: M_SHAW
SAC email: matthew.shaw@sap.com
SAC userName: M-SHAW

SAML SSO is set for mapping on custom because when SAML SSO is set for mapping on userid there are problems. For example the ( - ) dash character causes a problem (as do many others). The ( - ) dash (and others) can't be stored in the userid column (probably resolved with https://sapjira.wdf.sap.corp/browse/FPA00-5334) and so a custom SAML mapping must be used to store the ( - ) version and hence the need to create a user with a different userName from userid. The M-SHAW is used for SAML SSO mapping and integration with the IdP and the M_SHAW version is used because SAC can't store a ( - ) dash. The SAC version needs to look very similar to the _ version as all users are familiar with it.

The workaround continues: firstly the user is created (with a POST /Users) and then updated with a PUT /Users/Userid).  Its 2 steps, rather than 1.

The initial user creation must set the userName to be M_SHAW just so the userid is derived correctly and because you can't specify the userid to be different from the userName. Thus a second request is need to update the users userName.

This JIRA ER is to ease workaround mentioned above, but even when FPA00-5334 is provided, this is STILL a requirement because there will always be times you want a different userid from the userName.

This JIRA is for the POST /Users to allow both the userName and the userid to be specified in the request body and respected upon user creation. It would then mean a user can be created with a single request and not two.

This JIRA will also enable the userid to not be derived from the email when mapping on email. For example, if I want to create a user with userid MSHAW with email matthew.shaw@sap.com, but SAML SSO is set to map on email, then the userid will be derived from matthew.shaw@sap.com which is nothing like MSHAW. So this JIRA will also solve this problem which is very common.

(userName is used for SAML SSO mapping and is changeable when SAML SSO is set to email or custom)

Once provided, the user interface of SAC should change, so its possible that during the SAML SSO setup, both the userName is mapped in addition to the userId to allow for dynamic user creation. Otherwise dynamic user creation won't work very well for such use-cases.
