The scope is to do this for Story 2.0 toolbars, menus and dialogs. As we will only be able to deliver this for the embedding scenarios, components that are only available in enterprise and not embedded are out of scope.

Support for horizon themes was committed to S/4 and is planned to be delivered with story 2.0 in H1 2023. The upgrade to horizon can be started after an upgrade of UI5 planned for the early waves of Q1 2023.

As an end user I want to be able to consume SAC in the Fiori Horizon Themes (Morning, Evening, High Contrast)

As an embedding LoB I want SAC to adapt to the theme selected in the LoB tenant especially the Horizon themes.

As a product reusing SAC screens, I want SAC to be able to support the Fiori (Horizon) Themes. (DWC requirements)

h3. Current Situation

SAC cannot switch between different Themes as most screens do not support theming.
SAC cannot fully support Fiori Horizon as the UI5 version is too low. (Status August 2022)
SAC Story Canvas Elements do not have sufficient styling options to create the Horizon Look and Feel

h3. Currently planned workstreams (August 2022)
* Upgrade UI5 to be able to support Fiori Horizon [FPA00-47440]
* Work on making the SAC Story 2.0 View Toolbars Fiori Horizon Supported [FPA34-7771]
* Add styling options to allow designers to create a Story canvas theme aligned with Fiori Horizon [FPA34-7314]

The requirements are derived from a gap analysis and aim at closing the biggest gaps and to get close to the Horizon look and feel. Some small deviations from the defined Horizon look will not be closed.

Additionally we need to make sure that the default proposed colors are aligned with the fiori horizon morning and evening colors. 

The work is split up into three larger areas
* Creating the themes in SAC and shipping them to all enterprise tenants
* Delivering styling option enhancements necessary to make the themes work for OEM scenarios (reduced scope as  only certain widgets are available in the embedding scenrios)
* Delivering styling option enhancements to make themes work for the enterprise scope (all widgets of story 2.0 need to have sufficient styling options to show up in Horizon)


Another work stream is aimed at enabling the horizon themes for the toolbar and the rest of the application.

7,SAC BI Calculation required to Calculate the date/time difference between 2 date time (timestamp) fields,FPA34-7814,User Story,Open,FPA34,FPA34 - SAP Analytics Cloud Product Mgmt (Derek),software,Augmented BI and Planning for SAC,https://ifp.wdf.sap.corp/cprojects?sap-client=001&STARTVIEW=Projects&OBJECT_TYPE=TTO&GUID=6CAE8B27FCC31ED59D8BCB674218022A&sap-language=EN,Very High,"*Problem Statement:*

User would like to have a function to calculate difference between two datetime fields. Currently datediff function is able to calculate difference between two date fields only and result is in days.

*Use Case and Requirement:*
This is a requirement to introduce a calculation that allows to calculate difference between two date/time fields (for example: a timestamp) in the SAC story calculation editor. As a report designer in SAC, I should be able to create a calculation that provides difference b/w two date/time fields (for ex: ticket creation timestamp, ticket initial response timestamp, ticket resolution timestamp, etc.) in the SAC story calculation. This is especially important in applications catering to service scenarios, where there are multiple use cases to calculate the difference between any two date/time fields upto a granularity of hours, minutes and even seconds, for example to time taken for initial response to a customer ticket, time taken for ticket resolution etc. This is crucial to measure adherence to SLAs in many businesses. Also, it is important to introduce this calculation in the SAC story calculation editor, as that can also be applicable for embedded SAC use cases who do not have access to standard SAC modeler.

Currently, in SAC it is only possible to calculate the difference between Date between (days between two fields) and not with date and time.

*What already works?*

Today, SAC has DateDiff calculation that works for HANA live connectivity, however this works only if the dimension if of type date and the difference can be found up till ""day"" level granularity.

This also works for embedded SAC tenant in applications like C4C, using {+}extended HANA live connectivity{+}.

!screenshot-1.png|thumbnail!

*What does not work?*

SAC Enterprise customers as well as SAC embedded customers (that include applications like C4C and many other LOB applications that are on HANA Cloud today) have important dimensions - date/time fields stored as timestamps (i.e. both date and time Ex: ticket creation, ticket initial response, ticket resolution, etc).

A very common KPI for them is to calculate the response times, which means difference calculation between two timestamps. This cannot be done today in SAC for following reasons:
 * DateDiff calculation does not support timestamp dimensions,
 * DateDiff does not support hour, minutes and seconds for granularity.

Although un-related, it should be noted that for the embedded SAC usecase, timestamps are not available as hierarchy in embedded SAC, specifically with extended HANA live connectivity.

Hence, As a report designer for SAC, I should be able to create a calculation that provides difference between two date/time (timestamp) fields.

*Priority*

This need to be given very high priority because in the context of Customer Service related business process, datetime based KPI analysis is very important. For example to check the SLA compliance related to initial response time (it could be in minutes or hours. Not in days).

This is also a highly voted for requirement from SAC Enterprise customers as can be seen in this influence request: [https://influence.sap.com/sap/ino/#/idea/258836]
Customers who have voted for such a requirement include:
 * Business Connexion (Pty) Ltd
 * Cargolux Airlines International SA
 * Catigo Analytics AB
 * Cubis Solutions BV
 * ERCROS, S.A.
 * EnBW Energie Baden-W??????rttemberg AG
 * GERMANS BOADA, S.A.
 * HI PARTNERS HOLDCO VALUE ADDED SA
 * ""SAPRUN GROUP""
 * Logis GmbH
 * Lufthansa Technik AG
 * One World Technologies, Inc.
 * RINEDATA LIMITED
 * SAP
 * SEIDOR CONSULTING, S.L.

Also, in case of embedded SAC customers like C4C where embedded SAC is estimated to be used by over 2500 customers, C4C's current (not SAC) analytics solution allows users to calculate time difference between two time dimensions. A similar functionality is needed for SAC embedded in C4C. In the new C4C Service Cloud context, since C4C are relying only on SAC OEM (as they have not developed any alternative analytics offering in their new cloud native stack), lack of datetime difference calculation will be treated as a critical business feature limitation. Hence this is very important for CX Service Cloud use case perspective.

I can think of many cases where people would need to have a unique value for a particular dimension in a data intersection. In our particular case, hiring targets have unique IDs we do not want to repeat. TARGET ID FUNCTION LOCATION VALUE 123 Controllers United States 1 124 Tax Canada 3 125 IT India 7 ... we want to prevent a new data intersection from being entered into the model with the same target ID as shown below: 125 HR Thailand 2 Today the target ID is used as any dimension of the model where you can enter the same value for a dimension to multiple rows of transactional data (i.e. the same way you can add a function like Controllers to multiple target IDs in different locations, you can add target ID 125 in the example to multiple functions or locations as shown in the example above). Another example I can think of is someone who has a Planning Enable table to plan inventory where they can add equipment the company is planning to purchase in the near future. One of the dimensions of the model is some sort of number (a tag or a serial number) which is a unique number for that equipment. If you try to add an equipment with the exact same tag or serial number of an existing equipment already listed in the model, it would throw an error that the tag or serial number you are trying to add is already in use else you could have the following situation which is obviously incorrect because you shouldn't have the same serial number for two different equipments: SERIAL NUMBER EQUIPMENT TYPE BRAND MODEL QUANTITY 12345 Computer Dell Latitude 7300 1 12345 Monitor LG 24GN600 2 What is the opportunity/problem the request will address? The same member ID from a dimension cannot be added/used twice in a Planning Enabled table. What is the expected benefit? This prevents end users / planners from entering incorrect data into the model which could make things a lot more difficult down the line from a process perspective or to the very least would require controls to prevent duplicate member IDs from being used and additional effort to correct those entries in the model.

- color per range
- symbol per range - all shapes need to be available with all colors (currently limited to circle)
- style of threshold for tables (already available in story preferences but missing in theme preferences)

Currently threshold styling is defined on story/application level. The colors and symbols are assigned on story level. The style used for a table can be assigned in the story preferences or per table.

It is not possible to change the symbol, assigned color or display style (for table) at theme level (either in the theme preferences or CSS).

The functionality is needed as part of accessibility which was committed to S/4 for 2023. Canvas theming will be released to the OEMs as part of the accessibility workstream with the OEM availability of Story 2.0 planned for Q1 2023. This feature is necessary for Q1 QRC to make accessibility theming work as we cannot fulfill the 7:1 contrast to black and white background with one set of colors per threshold.

Possible solution:
- define thresholds in story as today including style; name functions as ID or add an additional ID
- define a set of threshold styles in theme preferences including an ID
- pull threshold style from theme if the ID exists in the theme, pull from story defined style if ID is not available as part of a theme

e.g.

Story defined sthresholds:

Warning - from theme - purple rectangle
Critical - from story - red circle

 - Data Authorization is applied for Cost Center
 say User 1 has access to Cost Centers - CC11, CC12, CC13

current behavior
 - If report is saved by selecting CC11 then for both User 1 and User 2 filter selected will be CC11
 since User 2 don't have access to CC11, data will not be displayed nor it will be populated in filter values

At the customer we see that they store version information on the second structure dimension. In order to achieve an IBCS compliant styling, the user needs to be able to style e.g. each bar in a bar chart with color and pattern.

Builder Panel from BSH:
 !Bildschirmfoto 2022-07-25 um 14.48.43.png|thumbnail! 

*Pain Point*
Currently the user could only use assign colors but there only color and no pattern is available.

*Additional information*
At BMW the version information was also stored in a generic dimension called value type. Here it's also not very convenient to style each bar correctly. Current workaround there is  to use restricted Measures.
Restricted Measures can't be used in the use case with the second structure because SAC does not support to restrict a measure based on the second structure.


*Possible Solution Spaces that were identified*
- allow in the Modeler to define second structure as version dimension and let the user add the semantics in the model (this would help so that the table also can automatically add the IBCS patterns)
- allow user to create restricted measures that restrict on members of the second structure
- enhance the assign colors panel so you can also add patterns",1,chart

The way comments are stored outside of the model with links only to Filter and DAC is making browsing comments for users complex. The expectation is that comments can be ""browsed"" throughout the model.

??????

Main gaps:
 * 
 ## Hierarchies are not acknowledged. A user expects with a selected parent the comments below the parent are also visible
 ## Comments should always be associated with the data, if no dimension member has been assigned # should be default
 ## Input control for version functions as AND filter now, thus not showing any comments with selection, version filter input control is needed for comment widget.
 ## Ideally when comments in the widget are selected, the data associated in the story should be highlighted.
 ## Datapoint classification, thus that there is a filter option ""chit chat"" and ""company Guidance"" for example, including who has the rights to add a given classification
 * Fixing 1 and 2 is also a pre req for exports to work as customers would expect.

*Point 4*

The comment widget should allow for context being visible, where for the dimensions in this model is the comment associated.

example belo should be able to show to user without design mode that the comment is on: 2022,Actual,Unassigned, Test

What is the opportunity/problem the request will address? Finance orientates toward parent-child hierarchy structure whereas business operations or datasets from BI systems are organized in level based structures. By allowing a dimension to support both simultaneously, a model can present both perspectives without needing to create redundant models and dimensions to store the same data simply to show the hierarchy differently. This would also eliminate unnecessary model/dimension linking in stories. What is the expected benefit?

Clarification:

BPC embedded leverages Master data from BW system(no duplication) for building the model.??????
However for SAC Planning, Google need to import the Dimension Master data into SAC or create private dimensions(duplicate data), with this process there is always sync issues and inconsistent master data and also due to this, Google faced recent challenges in linking dimensions from Live connections to Acquired connections model.
If Google have to migrate from BPC to SAC, without this feature, they have to build a lot of master data pipelines and lot of efforts for maintenance

Similar to how BPC leverage master data from BW, can SAC be improvised to refer the meta data(master data) from BW live for the Acquired connections model.

As a boardroom user (executive board and supervisory board member), I would like to be able to easily access the Digital Boardroom presentation with its latest stories on my mobile device, so that I don't get confused by opening outdated/inactive stories that are still shown in my ""recent files"" section on my mobile ""today"" home screen.

*Business Scenario / Example*
The executive and supervisory board members are the main stakeholder of our boardroom assets which are provided by our Company Steering Team. Our board members mainly access the Corporate Digital Boardroom presentation via mobile devices (e.g. iPhone). The Corporate Digital Boardroom presentation is the single entry point of all our assets. From time to time stories are deleted from the boardroom presentation since they become outdated or are replaced by a new version (with new story id). Because of that reason it's important that our users access our stories via the boardroom presentation and not via single stories that are still shown in their ""recent files"" section on their mobile home screen under the ?????????Today????????? tab. For example, Christian Klein constantly opens outdated and inactive stor""recent files"" section .This leads to unnecessary confusion and inconvenience. As workaround we set the catalog tab as default tab and only show our Digital Boardroom presentation to minimize the risk that they will use the ""recent files"" in the ?????????Today????????? tab to access boardroom stories.

*Value added if available*
Enable boardroom system admins to ""recent files"" tile of the ?????????Today????????? tab for mobile devices. In desktop version it's possible ""recent tiles"" tile in the default appearance settings of the boardroom system (see screenshot attached). The requested feature allows admins to go to system settings, open default appearance and adjust the default appearance for Home Screen Tiles on mobile devices. With that system administration settings should allow Admins to choose whether to hide recent stories or recent boardroom presentations as well as the option to disable the whole ?????????recent files????????? tile.

2) Assuming #1 is handled correct (i.e. ability to input price at a leaf level, but calculated weighted average price at an aggregate), some customers would like to treat the weighted average price calculation as an average calculation for input (i.e., they would like to enter an average price at the parent and have that automatically replicated at all relevant leaves).?????? Of course this can occur where the price member does not have a formula, and where average exception aggregation is used on the price member.?????? ??????This issue with this is that it's a misrepresentation of what average price is from a reporting perspective (i.e., it is not a weighted average price.

*Definition*

Analytics and Planning?????? platform with the lowest TCO (for SAP and for customer administration) for large scale* deployments.

End vision = 10k users as two year target with and 100k users as end target across an enterprise, 100k+ content items

Overall goals is to support operation at large scale, increase adoption and lower TCO

*The definition of ?????????large scale????????? within the scope of this discussion is for deployments of over 10000 BI users and 100?????????s of planning users. Beyond a simple single departmental deployment and typically multiple LOB or departments with multiple projects within them. Hence the number of users and the complexity of the tasks associated with organising and managing the content and planning and BI workflows will be high. Overall the number of citems.

*What problem will this solve?*
 * Allow customers to deploy at scale with low cost of ownership.

*Key Milestones:*

1.Tested and published performance, scalability and reliability benchmarks (internal) and sizing guidance (external)

2.Delegated administration capability (content and users, e.g. team of teams)

3.Fine grained permissions for key functionality???????????? (e.g. data egress features)

4.Robust deployment security capabilities (e.g. IP whitelist)

5.Customer managed backup and restore process

Ongoing Transversal: support standards (e.g. accessibility, regulatory requirements, internationalization)

*Dependencies*
 * Reliable (no system degradation) and scalable (can support 100k objects and users) tenants. TBD if this is the case today.??????
 * Ongoing platform refactoring including??????HANA cloud migration etc.
 * Data sources and modelling (assumption DWC)

When the color of a chart depends on the measure, patterns and colors as well as the way the bar is shown (show as) can be assigned specifically to a measure. If the color sync is enabled, the color and pattern change affects all other charts using the same measure. 

 !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! 

When a story is first created, the default is set for all three. The default is the side by side bars, the solid pattern and a color from the assigned palette.  When a change is made, the color and pattern change but the state of the setting goes from initial or default to custom. That means, the color is now hard coded and no longer pulled from the palette. 

The setting cannot be reset to pull colors from the color palette and there is no workaround like deleting the chart or the model from the story. The only way around it is to create a new story, where the designer never changes show as, pattern or color. Therefore we need to introduce a way to reset the color assignment. 

The functionality is needed as part of accessibility which was committed to S/4 for 2023. Canvas theming will be released to the OEMs as part of the accessibility workstream with the OEM availability of Story 2.0 planned for Q1 2023. This feature is necessary for Q1 QRC to make accessibility theming work as we cannot fulfill the 7:1 contrast to black and white background with one fixed color per measure. As customers most likely have used the functionality in the past, we need to give them the option to revert the setting.

1)?????? Check if public and/or private versions exceed 5m records without planning aC or DATA Locking is configured, suggest the modeler should configure the planning area.?????? Could take rule 1 into considerations as well.

3). Check the number of private and implicit public versions that exceed 5m records and provide warning information as large editable versions may be problematic.

4) Check that version size is not greater than 50m records. (Not a hard limit, but larger versions generally result in more systematic performance issues in terms of data actions and story performance.

??????

This check should be performed in the model vs. the story and should generate warnings as we are not checking against a real limitation.?????? There is some flexibility in the rules and thresholds as the most important thing is to work out how to raise these checks to the modeler.??????

_we are asking for a development, that gives the user an option to delete bookmarks from their list that have been shared with them by other users.

_We also don?????????t want to use global bookmarks because we want to avoid a huge mess of bookmarks in the tool visible to all users.

Note that today Data Insights are not listed or displayed in embedded workflows. Which means there is no way for LOBs to use the Independent/Standalone data analyzer today.

Today, the exploration triggers primarily from within stories, from the right click context of SAC tables and charts.??????

Phase 1 of the asks are listed in FPA34-7518

Phase 2 asks are listed below??????

 * In case a user would like to save his analysis, he would be able to save as data analyzer insights in SAC repository outside SAC story. Thethen be searched by API and opened directly via URL API in order for them to be embedded within iFrames by LOBs
 * When user goes back from data analyzer to story If insight was not saved, analysis done by user is lost and if he launches data analyzer again, he needs to start afresh
 * When user goes back from data analyzer to story If insight was saved, user should be able to navigate to insight directly from the right click menu of chart/table. This means the saved insights should be linked back to stories somehow so that user does not have to necessarily look/search for that insight.??????

There are 2 implementation steps for this request: (1) Quick-win: There should be a possibility to completely hide the Story-Filter Icon in Viewer mode for critical stories (see attachment). (2) There should be a possibility to hide/customize specific dimensions that can be used a Story-Filter in Viewer mode (see attachment). This request is a re-submission of #Request ID: 227070

Problem: Some dimensions are required in the data source but should not be available for filtering purposes. Example: The Currency dimension is required in the data source to be able to add a dynamic text to show the currency of the display

Benefit: What is the expected benefit? Better overview of available dimensions when user adds a story filter in the Viewer mode. Avoid situations where a user can get more information as intended by the story designer (need-to-know principle).

This is plausible for super users, but regular users cannot be expected to use custom planning areas efficiently. BUT, the developper who creates a Data action knows what custom planning area is required (DA prompts must be taken into account), so having this option in each DA would optimize user process a hundred-fold. What is the opportunity/problem the request will address? Today our main model has 150 million rows in each version. Local users have a reduced planning area through security, but regional users cannot, so often DAs will exceed available memory or if it runs, won't be able to publish.

??????

I'm creating this ticket because I haven't found any answers regarding how to change the number scale according to filter applied on the story. I have an SAC story in which I track the amount of ACV of our S/4HANA Cloud business. With the new deals from June, the total ACV is now higher than 1 billion:

!image-2022-07-05-11-31-11-901.png|width=844,height=255!

However, if I apply filters to the story selecting only a portion of it, the number should go down to Million Scale accordingly. However, it doesn't change and shows as 1.13 Billion:

!image-2022-07-05-11-32-45-858.png|width=847,height=255!

Also, the 'Average Deal Size' is a calculation that should follow the same logic. I found some posts on the SAC Community and they all say this is something SAC doesn't do automatically... which doesn't make any sense. Can you please check?

In Predictive Scenarios we have to select the forecasting level/combinations on which calculations are done via the entities selection. After the entities are selected, we can filter on them. Filters can only placed on selected dimensions/dimension attributes. It is not possible to select a dimension/attribute as a filter which is not part of the entities selection. We would like to have the possibilitie to place filters on dimensions which are not part of the entites list. (General filter for the data to be conisdered in the forecasting)

_What is the opportunity/problem the request_??????_will address?_

There are to main problems. First, we have to include dimensions/attributes into the entities only for enable filtering on this dimension, which will increase the complexity of the forecasting granularity unnecessary (as we have more entities selected then really needed). Second, the list of entities is limited to 5. So we cannot have more than 5 filters. Ife filters are needed, we would have to add preprocessing to the general process of forecasting via data actions and maybee even a seperate model, just for filtering/preprocessing. In total it will increase cost/effort for customers which is against the goal of SAC being a simple to use product for the end user.

In the screeshots attached you can see we have selected 5 entities. Only 2 are needed for the forecasting: Company Code and Material. The other 3 entities are only used as filters.

_What is the expected benefit?_

Avoid extra complexity for seperate pre processing steps and additional objects due to lack of simple filter possibilities in Predictive Scenarios.",5,filter

Some problems: When we overwrite the Compact Display option in design time of the Application with setCompactDisplayEnabled(), this will be reset when we use getDataSource().setVariableValue() to change the Variable value of the query and even cause a bug, in which no dimension value is shown in the table except for the Total value.

This is expect behaviour.

However, this behaviour is problematic in a production environment that enjoys a good life-cycle management and when users are some how segregated.

The problem is that when the story is developed in 'development', the prompts answers are provided and of course remembered even when the story is transported to production. It means that when you open the story in production is shows the last prompt values provided, which are the ones entered in development. 

This is a problem. because the value used in development might be for say 'Belgium', but the story is being opened by a set of users from 'Croatia', it means the users in Croatia have to keep changing the default value. It makes it really annoying because the dynamic default values are also not respected.

This means, that the business problem could be resolved by this JIRA ER, or (on some occasions, but not all) by another JIRA where by the default dynamic values are respected (except for time based objects as per JIRA https://sapjira.wdf.sap.corp/browse/FPA34-2869), however its highly likely this JIRA will be needed in its entirety and especially when non-default dynamic variables are used.

There is a workaround, but its a little poor:

The workaround is to change the mandatory prompts to optional ones, then run the story removing all prompt values. Save the story. Then change the optional prompts back to mandatory. This workaround, apart from the obvious downsides, also has a number of limitations when queries are merged together. Its seems very problematic in such cases as two prompt screens are then shown. (its unclear if the two prompts screen issue is resolved once the prompts are set back to mandatory or not).

A bit more:
The feature was provided in SAP BusinessObjects BI Platform Web Intelligence and customers are expecting this to be present in SAC.

What is this request:
The request is to provide a means by which a story developer can clear/purge/delete prompt values/answers previously provided, even for mandatory prompts as much as optional prompts. The story developer should then be able to save the story with the previous prompt values having been removed.

""# - Unassigned"" member of a reference dimension shoud support Validation Rule with All members of MATCHED Dimension. What is the opportunity/problem the request will address? We often use ""# - Unassigned"" member on a dimension, let's call it ""dim A"", when this dimension ""dim A"" is not relevant for the current key figure. In this case, any validation rule constraining what members of reference dimension ""dim A"" can be combined with what members of the MATCHED dimension, let's call it ""dim B"" is NOT RELEVANT as the usage of ""# - Unassigned member"" of dim A means that we don't care about dim A for the current key figure. So why applying the validation rule in this case ? In this case, we should be able to easily tell to SAC that ""# - Unassigned member"" of dim A (reference dimension) can be used with all members of dim B (MATCHED dimension). The current behavior of SAC authorizes ""# - Unassigned member"" of dim A (reference dimension) ONLY to be combined with dim B members (MATCHED dimension members) that are valid with the other members of dim A ! There is a kind of useless contraint here... The current workaround consists in creating a fake member on reference dimension (dim A) combined with the list of all members of the MATCHED dimension (dim B) (even if there are thousands of members on MATCHED dimension...). This not a good approach. Quite uneasy to maintain. What is the expected benefit?

_Usecase_

Two models (Model A & Model B) are linked based on a Dimension (Dim X) and when a filter is applied based on Model A-Dim Y dimension, by default an indirect filter is applied to Model B resulting in long running query on Model B in the back-end even though Dim Y is not part of linked dimensions. User should have an option to enable or disable indirect filtering as not in all cases we might need Model B to be filtered using un-linked dimensions.

Concrete Example:

Story A consists of two pages. Page 1 shows HR data, Page 2 shows Sales data.
The customer wants to have Region (which is a common dimension in both models) as Story Filter and leverage link dimension to have a single selection for both.
Creating Input Controls for e.g. Products (which are just part of the sales model) will create indirect filter & decrease performance, while it is useless in that case.

It means the export data API has a limited use-case, it can really only be used to export actual data and not its dimension data, since dimension data without any hierarchy is not complete and thus means its unreliable and requires manual re-work to any changes made in SAC. It means the export data API, even when used with an SAP connector (like DWC or HANA) requires extra manual work and/or unsupported 'adjustments' in the target systems.

When using properties on a Version dimension, and users want to create a new version they need to go through a heavy manual process: 1) Open up a story, with a table connected to the planning model 2) Go into Version Management Panel 3) Copy an existing version to a Private Version 4) Publish the Private Version 5) Go into Files Area to find the planning model 6) Open the model 7) Open the Version dimension 8) Add property values to the newly created version 9) If Data Acccess Control is enabled on the Version dimension, add respective teams that use the new version to Read/Write columns 10) Repeat entire above process for every planning model where the same version is needed This is unmanageable. And with application designer, not all steps can be automated yet.

What is the opportunity/problem the request will address? Where different types of forecast / plan etc. have different submission requirements, it is not currently possible to use validation rules, since they apply globally to all versions / time periods. For example, you may wish to limit the dimension combinations used for a high level quick forecast, whereas a detailed bottom up budget would not require the same restrictions. In this scenario, validation rules can't be used to enforce the summary level inputs in the quick forecast, because they would also apply to other versions such as the budget. A similar limitation exists where valid dimension member combinations might change over time, e.g. member A is associated with member B up to Dec 2020, but associated with member C from Jan 2021 onwards. Validation rules could not be used here, since they to apply to all time periods. What is the expected benefit?

It would be very helpful for the end user to select a node in a hierarchy as scope for a data action. If the parameter is used in an advanced formula, only leaf level is supported. This is not suitable for the end user, because he would have to select hundreds or even thousands of leaves within a hierarchy to select the complete subtree.

Example use case from customer BMW:

The customer wants to do target planning on different levels within a hierarchy according to the distribution of values from the previous year.
Special requirement was that disaggregation should stop at a speed hierarchy level.
In detail, this means that the first persona writes the total value to the top node, with all leaves and nodes below being empty. The second persona goes in and allocates this value for the next level, for his/her specific area.
We resolved this by adding dummy-leaves for each hierarchy level where we can write these values to. These were then added in property colums (h0 parent, h1 parent, h2 parent, etc.) with??????_manual_ work. However, not even those properties can be used as parameters to filter the data action.

We&rsquo;re searching for a solution like BPC BPF. When the user submit the task, the access for attached files should be limited. To use data locking task correctly, our driving dimensions should be cost center, gl_account, time and version and it is too hard to manage. Admin user should know every responsible user who will be assigned for related granularity. It means a process(input task + data locking task) should be created for each user. It means hundreds of input task+data locking task have to be managed. Additionally, owner has to select assignee one by one. We created teams for each story. We need to able to select team to assign the task ( because we have more than 1000 users) and we need to follow process user by user individually. We have lots of users and stories. That is why we need more feasible solution. We already have data access feature for dimensions and it is a good solution to hide the related file for the user who pushed the &ldquo;Submit&rdquo; button. If a user is able to change the input data after it is submitted, it means they are able to change the input data even it is approved by the reviewer. That is not preferred case. Customer wants to lock the data after it is submitted. Even if the work file is not accessible via task anymore, it is still available via file repository. So, it should be closed to change data even the file repository. As a result, we can summarize the requirement as below ; If a user has no open task for a specific template, this template should be closed to change for this user even from task or file repository. It should not be closed read the data, it should be closed to change the data. Best Regards Link to request: https://influence.sap.com/sap/ino/#/idea/238364",3,data

Ideally, you would be able to use some special value like ""&lt;any&gt;"" or ""&lt;all&gt;"" or a wildcard symbol to allow any member in the validated/connected dimension. Currently to do this, you would have to fill out the property of the first dimension with a comma separated list containing all members of the second dimension (e.g. member1,member2,member3.....) and this is not practical. To describe this slightly differently, we need a special value in a property to allow us to turn off validation rules for certain members. Therefore all combinations would be allowed, and effectively validation rules are turned off for certain members. What is the opportunity/problem the request will address?

Current in the validation rules, you can tie a cost center to a specific cost center, but you are not able to allow cost center: unassigned to post to any profit center. The # cost center needs flagged with a * or &lt;all&gt; or &lt;any&gt; or some special value to will allow data in cost center # to be populated into any member of the profit center dimension. Here is another: A profit center belongs to a company code, but a company code does not need to have data in a profit center. Current in the validation rules, you can tie a profit center to a specific company code, but you are not able to allow profit center: unassigned to post to any company code. The # profit center needs flagged with a * or &lt;all&gt; or &lt;any&gt; or some special value to will allow data in profit center # to be populated into any member of the profit center dimension. What is the expected benefit? This will allow SAC validation rules to be better utilized in line with the structure of the data that most customers load from an S/4 source systems (Finance / Controlling). From a reporting standpoint, this will improve data quality by removing invalid combinations of dimensions as this functionality intends. From a planning standpoint, it will allow us to input data by a certain dimension (such as cost center) without worrying about whether it goes to the proper members of related dimension (company code, profit center). This will improve user experience for planners. Link to request: https://influence.sap.com/sap/ino/#/idea/277515",9,dimension

A communication strategy for Unidas - What story will we tell the customers?  We have apparently already made the high level story public.  This will profoundly impact  modeling, data ingestion, data prep and blending architecture and workflows.  As soon as we have a high level story in each of these areas -  a story that we are committed to executing - then we need to give clarity.  Otherwise, customers will start asking where we are going with these things and it can become a PR debacle if we don't have answers.

This would also be the case for BW live data being consumed through the BW bridge.

But what if the customer is bypassing the bridge and consuming their BW queries directly in SAC; bypassing the bridge layer?

The idea behind this user story is to now even bother trying to blend BW live sources in the data suite, but rather take the same approach as Analysis Office when blending data with BW queries; use BW workspaces. Rather than pushing on-prem data up to the cloud and blending there, we push the cloud data down into the on-prem BW workspace and join it there.

We could potentially use the same APIs as AO and the Netweaver Business Client to save effort and create a more modern and user friendly UX alternative to the Business Client.

as requested, I'm creating this request on behalf of the Bosch escalation team:

The customer uses links to open SAC Stories and Analytic Applications via URL from external pages. They are not happy with the loading performance of the content.

During the RCA of the Global Escalation, they noticed a large amount of JavaScript files and are particularly concerned about the SAC application startup runtime, i.e. the time until we start loading the actual story/application. This runtime depends very much on the client resources (CPU) and differ a lot. The regular business user does not have a high end laptop. Hence, the user faces longer runtimes. The team tested the browser benchmark scores (captured via https://browserbench.org/Speedometer2.0/) and found large differences between Bosch end user and SAP clients.

The customer shared 3 trace files for loading a simple application. I have uploaded them here: [Trace Files on OneDrive Share|https://sap-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/p/christian_schoenbein/EptbyZGaM8BCvMPOqXznoXEB-LHR_0JXHw4WSG8PZxRXwg?e=PbVHKz].

Unfortunately, we do not have RAPTR traces. So, I will use the contentlib request fetching the story content as the one relevant to the start of loading of the story/application content. 
# The fast case: We start loading the contentlib after 7.79s.
# The slow case: We start loading the contentlib after 10.59s.

Both scenarios have been captured with a warm cache and only few kB have been transferred. The CPU resources seem to have a rather large impact on this loading time.

The customer expectation would be to be able to open a story/application without having to wait for that long to start rendering the story/application content.

Best regards,
Christian

Simple Example:

There is a story filter, which has 5 values ({_}A{_},??????{_}B{_},??????{_}C{_},??????{_}D{_},??????{_}E{_}). Due to Cascading Effect, the user only sees the following filter entries if the filter is opened.
 * [X]??????_All_

 * [X]??????_B_

*Case 1:*??????The us""shortest way""; B is deselected. This results in the following view:
 * [?????? ]??????_All_
 * [?????? ]??????_A_
 * [X]??????_B_

However, the actual selection result is??????{_}B{_},??????{_}C{_},?""inactive values"" are kept selected, too.

*Case 2:*??????If the user would first deselect??????_All_??????and then select??????{_}B{_}, the result looks the same (looking at the dropdown:

 * [?????? ]??????_A_
 * [X]??????_B_

In this case, the actual result is only??????{_}B{_}.

=> The selection in the LOV looks the same both times, but the result is different.

The idea of having the new option active would be that in Case 1 also only the visible values are selected as the actual results. So that the visible selection corresponds to the actual selection.

The dynamic text is widely used to give context to a report. However, the capabilities are limited. Can we have a formula-based dynamic text???????

For example, I can link it with story filter selection. But lets I want to do some more processing to it before displaying it.??????

One of the scenarios could be a story filter is returning Financial Year selection, Jan 21 based on a financial year enabled model with the start of the year to denote the Year. Now in the report to give an actual context to the user, I would like to manipulate the selection string to make it Jan 22.

In Webi, the user response function returns the selection made by the user, and then I can further process it by webi formula. So in the above example, I can covert the date string above to date using todate and then add 1 year and format it back to month and year and display it.??????

This is very critical when SAC is getting projected as a tool for enterprise reporting where theneed a lot more text to show the context based on the input made on the screen.

With the current product capabilities, restricted measures should be created in order to make waterfall charts meaningful (e.g restricted measures to determine the nature of the operating expenses to come up with EBIT). Adding dimensions is useful for drill down purposes only.

For example, I want to provide an input control for product selection and in the input control, I want to show only finished goods (Material Type).

By Property. Here allow the user to choose by Material Type and list the properd let him choose one or more property values.??????

The Improvement would be giving a SAC user with no editing rights, the possibility of selecting what hierarchy to use in a Story Filter

At the moment, when a Story Filter is put in place for a dimension with hierarchies, it is possible to select the hierarchy only at the time of setting up the filter. However, if a normal user with no editing rights wants to use another hierarchy, it is not possible to choose which one to use and the user is limited to what the person who created the story used. For example, if I have two hierarchies for Plant, one being DCs and another National Stores, the user cannot choose which one to use in the filter. If DCs has been used at the time of setting up the Story Filter, the user is not able to choose National Stores.

The benefit would be usability and user experience, simplifying the usage of a hierarchy. If the requirement is for the end-user to be able to choose the hierarchy, a workaround has to be used, either having a page filter (or table) with the dimension or having two variables, one for selecting the hierarchy and another one for the nodes.",5,filter

We are using SAC for a critical Month End Closure related process for Charging & Allocations, where we use the allocation functionality in SAC. The data is provided via BPC source

After successful testing, we would like to export-import the model in SAC to SAC PRD (after transporting BPC datasource changes). As the model is initially pointing towards SAC QA, we would like the datasource to be mapped to SAC PRD at import (or via a manual activity).

Unfortunately, we can only select a specific date as value (eg. 2020-08-11). Since import jobs are meant to import data on a regular basis, we would need a dynamic date to be able to pick up records based on the day the import job is run. We would require the following: Field: 'Valid From' Before or Including 'SYSTEM DATE' Field: 'Valid To' After or Including 'SYSTEM DATE' This is useful for example to filter on price condition records that are valid today. We are not interested in picking up all the delimited time ranges with prices valid in the past or the future (millions of records). We only want to import the record with the price that is valid today (day of import job run). See attachments for a screenshot of the problem.

Today there is no data type DATE for property available.

Today there is no option to add properties into grid for data lock management

With that a usage of past periods variables for locking and validation are needed.

This would reduce manual effort period by period for manual locking of past periods against data changes and help for customer adoption and trust having more automatism

As a planner I would like to avoid input readiness for past periods or invalid combinations.

When editing an import in a new model, on the import settings' ""clean and replace"" scoping, if the version is changed, the import should load to that selected version (it does not). What is the opportunity/problem the request will address? It is not obvious that the ""clean and replace"" scoping for version does not change the mapping of the version dimension in the ""map to target"" step, which is where the mapping actually matters. When a user first creates an import, they are able to select the version on the ""clean and replace"" scoping, which sets the version in the ""map to target"", but when they try to Edit the import later, the ""map to target"" does not update/remap. Only when the map to target is empty does the ""clean and replace"" fill in the blank. It should update the the map to target version each and every time the ""clean and replace"" version is changed. What is the expected benefit? Less error and frustration when importing data. The false conclusion the imports need to be re-created because the version mapping is locked in by a one-time-only selection. This change makes the ""clean and replace"" setting feature more useful.

Example: S/4HANA Service ""SD_SOFM_SRV"" has multiple entitites. This perfectly serves all needs today and probably in the future. Entitites useful in thes scenario: One is the SalesOrders basic data, one is the ProcessQuery. I have already created the model &amp; the job to import the Process data from one of the entities. Now I want to extend the model by a SalesOrganization dimension. I wish we could simply Add a second import job on the SalesOrders basic data entity, select the vkorg to be mapped to the newly added SalesOrg dimension and select the SalesOrderID as a join criteria. In the next step assign the orderID to the orderID dimension in the already loaded model as the join criteria and the vkorg to the vkorg dimension as the desired data to be loaded.

What is the opportunity/problem the request will address? Today, given the above example scenario, it is possible to add multiple jobs. BUT it is not possible to do an import without serving ALL dimensions / measures in the model. Instead all dimensions must be served by a datasource query. This forces anyone to always create the perfect datasource with all needed data or maintain multiple SAC models and try to join them in stories (which has it's flaws on its own).

When the Import jobs lists is long, the admin needs to wait for the Import jobs to populate, which refreshes with delay then shifts the export job button down off the screen and requires scrolling down in order to click it.

414,Link dimensions accross Import model and BW Live model on compounded BW objects,FPA34-7365,User Story,Considered,FPA34,FPA34 - SAP Analytics Cloud Product Mgmt (Derek),software,Augmented BI and Planning for SAC,https://ifp.wdf.sap.corp/cprojects?sap-client=001&STARTVIEW=Projects&OBJECT_TYPE=TTO&GUID=6CAE8B27FCC31ED59D8BCB674218022A&sap-language=EN,Medium,"Description We have been facing challenges when linking dimensions across different types of models (BW Live and Import Models). This was covered in incident 352545 / 2021. The scenario is that some BW queries are not performing good enough to support dashboarding in SAC using live connection. One relatively simple way of handling this issue is to schedule the BW query execution in a SAC import model so that data is prepared before the user is requesting it - really nice feature. For other BW queries/key figures performance is very good and BW Live connection is then the preferred option. When transferring user selections using ""Link dimensions"" across tables/charts using the two different connection types (Live and Import models) issues arise for compunded BW objects. One common example is on the article hierarchy. User might select a main category (BW technical name 0CM_CDT3) in one table and then expect another table to be filtered on the selected main category. In BW the standard object 0CM_CDT3 is compounded to 0CM_HIED. This means that when 0CM_CDT3 is loaded to a import model the value is a concatenation of the values for the two objects, eg AH/R335. Even though main category (0CM_CDT3) is linked between the import model and the live model the selection of AH/R335 cannot be transferred to the live model. The live model is using an internal representation of the value. Here the ""/"" is removed so the internal representation is AHR335. Consequence is that live model is not returning any data when filtered on AH/R335 which very much looks like an error to the user and the developer. A workaround suggested by SAP is to create a calculated dimension on the table using the import model in order to remove the ""/"" and match the internal representation. This can be done using a formula like CONCAT(SPLIT([d/""IMPORT_Y__VMMSD_C01_Q0001_ITSMIK15"":AH_SectorDI_6a342q04t2].[p/ID],""/"" ,1), SPLIT([d/""IMPORT_Y__VMMSD_C01_Q0001_ITSMIK15"":AH_SectorDI_6a342q04t2].[p/ID],""/"" ,2)) The calculated dimension format is then equivalent to the live connection and the value AHR335 can be passed on to the live connection which is filtered accordingly. Figuring out this can take a long time and raising incident to SAP since it looks like an error in SAC. What is the opportunity/problem the request will address? Make SAC handle the translation from internal to external representation in a more smooth way without requiring developement each and every time an import model is to be linked to a live conneciton. One option could be adding the internal representation to the import model automatically or showing this somehow to the user, so the user can understand why the linking is not working. What is the expected benefit? To make it easier and simpler for users and developers to utilize the huge benefits of combining import models and live models and transferring filters.

??????

We are supporting Dell for their FP&A Planning project with SAC-P. One of their calculation requirement is to show shared percentage based on Product hierarchy. In their planning tables they need to check five years historical data and one year forecast data. All the 6 years data are sitting in one version for the historical data is generated based on different sources and it may be various for different Forecast/Planning version.

While showing all 6 years data in one table, the GrandTotal will calculate the subtotal for all the years. However, the requirement is to calculate the subtotals and shared percentage on each period. Do we have any plan to enhance the function GrandTotal() to have ability to pass in arguments to let the system separate the totals based on a dimension like Date in this case?

The customer also has the requirement to do adjustment for the shared percentage to get the result affect back to the dollar amount. And because of it, the project team have toieve it by creating inverse formulas together with GrandTotal() in calculated measures. The Story formulas cannot be leveraged in this case.

439,SAC embedded / respect Connection ID needed for Life-cycle management,FPA34-7489,User Story,Open,FPA34,FPA34 - SAP Analytics Cloud Product Mgmt (Derek),software,Augmented BI and Planning for SAC,https://ifp.wdf.sap.corp/cprojects?sap-client=001&STARTVIEW=Projects&OBJECT_TYPE=TTO&GUID=6CAE8B27FCC31ED59D8BCB674218022A&sap-language=EN,Medium,"Today with the SAP Analytics Cloud Embedded Edition, it is only possible to add or delete a live connection via the API. It is not possible to amend, or update an existing live connection. Instead, you must delete the connection and create a new one.

However there are very serious failing and flaws with such a design. Since it is critical that an update to connection respects the existing connection ID:
*  ?????????Custom Groups????????? are created within a Story of one environment (dev) and then transported to another (prod). Although the ?????????Custom Groups????????? are stored within the story, they are actually associated to the connection ID. So, if the connection id in the target (prod) is different, then you won?????????t be able to re-use those Custom Groups you created in the source (dev).

Although Custom Groups are currently only available for BW, and although currently SAC Embedded only supports HANA connections, there's a problem just waiting to happen when SAC Embedded needs to support  connection ID across the landscape.

* The best practices (as documented and shared by myself) describes how live connections should be managed across the landscape. To cut it short, it requires transporting/promoting the connection from source to target and then updating this (now existing) connection and NOT to create a new connection. This is important because of (Custom Groups above), but also because models relate to connections by ID. If the connections have different ID's then the user has to manually change the relationship to the connection each time the model is transported (and this isn't good practice).

So, this Enhancement Request is to allow the SAP Embedded Edition to UPDATE an existing live connection without the need to delete it, but instead to respect the connection ID already present.

Whilst today there are very few customers using the SAC Embedded Edition, this ER needs to be put onto the roadmap. This JIRA also acts as an early 'heads-up' and should be used to input into further design documents.  It's also advised to seek expert help from those with implementation and cross solution expertise.

This stops cross-calculations from being a valid use case in forms where data entry is required on one cross-calculation but not on another. This also poses a security defect as users could enter data on ""locked"" regions by using a cross-calculation to bypass the data locks. The work-arounds for this limitation are: (1) to configure cell locking, however this is not possible in Analytics Designer. It is also not dynamic when a user changes the drill state of a dimension in a table. (2) If the entire table can be locked (i.e. no data entry required) then Planning Enabled setting can be turned off. However this limits a whole host of business planning scenarios. Neither work-around fully addresses the needs of many common planning scenarios. What is the opportunity/problem the request will address? Opportunity: By enabling data locking on Restricted Measures in stories &amp; analytics applications developers &amp; consultants can use restricted measures and be sure they are secure in planning projects. This also allows more sophisticated planning forms to be created for specific end user need. Problem: Restricted Measure security is not consistent with the rest of SAC Data Locking principles and is a potential risk for customers looking to manage the data entry process for their business. What is the expected benefit? 1) Improve the consistency of data locking principles across an SAC planning system. 2) Give customers more confidence they can safely use data locking functionality without risk of incorrect entry. 3) Address a very common requirement of being able to see summarized/restricted (but also protected) data in the same table where planned values are required.

This confuses end users with a message that they may have potentially planned data in regions they do not have access to. Data Actions currently are too limited.. so we cannot always properly filter the calculations to regions that users have access to. Proposal: Create a Data Action feature that respects data locks.

As a change made by 1 business user could have immediate impact on all other users. I propose to create a ""Revert &amp; Restore"" feature where business users can revert unwanted model changes back to any time in the past. A restore point can be chosen based on a model revision version and a point in time. What is the opportunity/problem the request will address? Quick issue resolution is absolutely critical for financial planners (facing deadlines), who are collaborating on a central planning system. Being able to quickly revert unwanted changes is one of the essential requirements for a centralized planning system. What is the expected benefit? Quick issue resolution will be possible by (key) business user. IT (SAP Cloud) doesn't need to be involved in executing complex database restore procedures, which could occur in a critical time path.

I documented the use case, see included screenshot in my example i just want to modify the job grade of the employee

1/ If i create an input table with just the job grade and add a new member to promote the employee next year then the other master data are automatically allocated to the m""Unassigned"".

2/ If I use a table with all dimensions, when i add a new member I have to repopulate all dimensions one by one which isn't user friendly and cumbersome and not relevant in this use case, plus you cannot copy/paste the master data from one row to another??????

Could we enhance the Add member feature? Here several options:

a/create an option to duplicate on a new row all source master data and let the end user only??????modify the master data he wants?

b/ create an option that would keep the other master data of the other dimensions unchanged referring to a version and a date (more elaborated scenario based on versioning).

We have stuff working for the general Live HANA case, but for historical reasons the SAC model code path depends on the naming because the code was written before LevelType information was available in the InA metadata. In wave 2020.08 last year there was an emergency request from the DWC team to switch DWC models to the SAC model code path so effectively the generic handling was lost back then.

A medium term fix was developed but at the same time the way DWC creates the time dimensions was changed which then necessitated the naming convention restriction for the lowest level of each time dimension (the remaining levels come from DWC created artifacts that meet the required naming convention).

We have somewhat of an idea for how to change the SAC model code path to no l on naming, but given the critical BOLT work right now we just did not have the time to work on this yet.",2,dwc

Allow the ability to create a custom variable that could store a fiscal period value and then the variable could be added to each query.

We thought that there is highly recommended have the ability to build in one single input control fixed date ranges and dynamic date ranges as one more option in one selector. This, will give us the ability to create for example a filter which allows user to change easily between dynamic predefined input controls such (from 5 days ago until today) with fixed range input controls (from ""pick a date"" to ""pick a date"").

Problem: We all have client requirements' and our mission is fulfilled its and improve the user experience on our dashboards, having the ability to include in one single input control fixed and dynamic ranges allows us quickly filter the data for different periods (dynamically for example Month to date) or fixed ranges (from x to y day).

Reporting Requirement is to bring together BW Query Results with DWC based data.

Current SAC Blending approach has limitations in functionality and performance challenges.

--------------------

Usecase Richemont:

Blending BW Live with Imported data -->should this be moved to Blending BW with DWC data?

Following requirements missing from Richemont-side

_FPA00-23077 - Not possible to change member order in a blended table_

_FPA34-2471 - DTC - Sorting / Top N option for tables with blended models_

_FPA34-4110 - DTC - Show Totals in a BW Live, HANA Live and Excel Blending scenario_

_FPA34-7007 - [BW Live] Sort/Rank on BW live blending with import model in table_

??????And for DWC I have the following gaps from Marco:
 * DWC works at data base tables or views level, it doesn?????????t work fine with BW queries.
 * Today blending is used to complement data from BW query witha. With DWC we would have to create dedicated view, reproducing BW queries, which is an option for specific cases but not for all

-----------------

Usecase Fresenius-Kabi:

Combination of data which are in SAP BW with non SAP data which we integrate in DWC.

With this approach we want to user the power of DWC (unlock data) and combine it with data which we have already in BW and reporting is done via SAC

For example enrich existing sales reporting with non SAP data which are ext. market data, wholesaler data ?????????

With this we could replace reporting in other tools like Qlik, TM1, Microstrategy.

Currently in SAC, the ""export"" and ""apply permission"" features are only available at the ""Story"" level. Need the ability to export as well as apply object permissions at individual ""Page"" level (more granular) within a ""Story""??

Problem: 1> The export capability is only available at the story level. So, even if we made changes to specific pages, we still need to export and migrate the complete story which is quite an overhead from a maintenance perspective. Also, in terms of the readability of code, having smaller chunks of code makes it much more concise. 2> The object-level permissions need to be applied at the ""Story"" level currently, which makes it rigid as it applies to the complete story irrespective of the number of pages it contains. This prevents sharing individual ""Pages"" to different user groups within a story. Having this at the ""Page"" level makes it more collaborative. Moreover, both the above items are basic features available in any reporting tool which is lacking in SAC.

Benefit: With the above two enhancements, it provides the ability to manage the objects at a more granular level (page) than the current state which makes it more efficient from a maintenance perspective. It also provides the ability to share and control the permissions at the ""Page"" level rather than the ""Story"" level making it much more collaborative. Please let us know if you need more details.

* request body contains the userName (no user id can be specified)
resulting in a new user being created with the:
* response body containing the userid and the userName

If the SAML SSO is set for mapping on email, the userid is derived from the email address.
If the SAML SSO is set for mapping on userid, the userid is the same as the userName.
If the SAML SSO is set for mapping on custom, the userid is the derived from the userName (but not necessarily matching it).

This behaviour causes a problem because there are times customers want to create a user with a userid different from the userName. This typically happens when performing SAML SSO is set for mapping on custom. In such cases you could well want:
SAC userid: M_SHAW
SAC email: matthew.shaw@sap.com
SAC userName: M-SHAW

SAML SSO is set for mapping on custom because when SAML SSO is set for mapping on userid there are problems. For example the ( - ) dash character causes a problem (as do many others). The ( - ) dash (and others) can't be stored in the userid column (probably resolved with https://sapjira.wdf.sap.corp/browse/FPA00-5334) and so a custom SAML mapping must be used to store the ( - ) version and hence the need to create a user with a different userName from userid. The M-SHAW is used for SAML SSO mapping and integration with the IdP and the M_SHAW version is used because SAC can't store a ( - ) dash. The SAC version needs to look very similar to the _ version as all users are familiar with it.

The workaround continues: firstly the user is created (with a POST /Users) and then updated with a PUT /Users/Userid).  Its 2 steps, rather than 1.

The initial user creation must set the userName to be M_SHAW just so the userid is derived correctly and because you can't specify the userid to be different from the userName. Thus a second request is need to update the users userName.

This JIRA ER is to ease workaround mentioned above, but even when FPA00-5334 is provided, this is STILL a requirement because there will always be times you want a different userid from the userName.

This JIRA is for the POST /Users to allow both the userName and the userid to be specified in the request body and respected upon user creation. It would then mean a user can be created with a single request and not two.

This JIRA will also enable the userid to not be derived from the email when mapping on email. For example, if I want to create a user with userid MSHAW with email matthew.shaw@sap.com, but SAML SSO is set to map on email, then the userid will be derived from matthew.shaw@sap.com which is nothing like MSHAW. So this JIRA will also solve this problem which is very common.

(userName is used for SAML SSO mapping and is changeable when SAML SSO is set to email or custom)

Once provided, the user interface of SAC should change, so its possible that during the SAML SSO setup, both the userName is mapped in addition to the userId to allow for dynamic user creation. Otherwise dynamic user creation won't work very well for such use-cases.

+*Monsanto*+
 Hi All,

I would like to share feedback from Monsanto visit this week. I presented BOC to them and showcased the visualizations, planning, predictive and data connectivity capabilities the product offers today. While they like the visualization/exploraration capabilities of the product, they are pretty set on their data access approach. Key requirements that came up during that meeting for Monsanto to consider using BOC are:

1) Live Connections to variety of SQL data sources (Oracle, Exadata, SQL, Teradata, PostGres, MySqL). The data sources are dispersed and while many data sources are on premise, they have a significant number of data sources hosted on AWS. Monsanto has large databases and they are not interested in replicating data for various reasons(having to re-build autorizations etc.) and would like BOC to access those source in a Live fashion ????????? like what we do with HANA today. I discussed the offerings that APOS provides and have some follow items to take back to the partner. The current capability of the partner solution is also limited because it only works with SQL Server and Analysis services. We will need to understand their roadmap to support connectivity to the data sources mentioned above, with and without going through the universe layer. I see online SQL access is on our roadmap as well. Do we have any concrete plans on this topic? We will need to look beyond just providing this access through the universe layer as Monsanto is looking to move away from their on-premise BI4 system.

1) SAP Analytics Cloud Authentication method is the default AND
2) A SCIM API /Users POST request is made, where the userName matches an existing user, but the email does NOT match that same existing user

then:
A new user is created! The userName allocated will typically have a _1 added to the end

Example existing user:
userid: MATTHEW email:matthew@sap.com

Make a POST request to /Users with requestBody userName=MATTHEW and email=matthew.shaw@sap.com
this will result in a 201 with a requestBody containing userName=MATTHEW_1
And thus we will have 2 users:

userid: MATTHEW email:matthew@sap.com
userid: MATTHEW_1 email:matthew.shaw@sap.com

The problem with this are mutliple:
* we have more than 1 user! We have a ""duplicated user""
* The requestBody (containing the userName MATTHEW_1) isn't a userName that we wanted. Worse still, is that about every 3000 to 5000 users this POST /Users will result in a HTTP 500. When this happens the user will still be created. But what's terrible is we have no idea what the new userName that was created is. Then, if you try to repeat your call (that previously returned a HTTP 500). you'll get a 409 conflict. But the conflict is not with the userName you think! The conflict will be with the userName you don't know the value of. So you then have to perform a GET of the user -but look, you'll get back the user MATTHEW, not MATTHEW_1. So you could try to update MATTHEW with the new email, but you'll then get a HTTP 400 because the email matthew.shaw@sap.com is already in use by another user MATTHEW_1.  It all gets very messy!

So this ER is for the POST /Users to NEVER create a user if when email does NOT match the email of the requestBody  (matching on the userName)

Today, the  POST /Users will NOT create a user only when the email does match the email of the requestBody (matching on the userName)

As an reporting user (like a controller) I would like to have the show and hide columns in a SAC Story and save this as a bookmark.

??????

Business Scenario

The Controller in question goes into a report that contains ACT, FC, BUD and YoY changes, for all four quarters, in a table. They only need ACT, but another controller only needs FC, so we are showing all four measures in the report. To save time, both Controllers would like to hide all columns they don't need and bookmark the report, so that they can use it every time with just one click.

??????

Value added

The nature of financial reporting alone makes such a feature very necessary, as these reports are used monthly by all controllers and it makes no sense to have a report for every single use case. Instead, a bookmark of the optimal column layout that is also shareable amongst team members and management would greatly improve usability and reduce effort on Controlling and system level.

Today, the initial design of this feature is the isConcurrent property is NOT updatable or changeable when the http header x-ignore-roles-if-missing=true is used.

This is a problem, because when header x-ignore-roles-if-missing=true is used, its because the 'client' system doesn't know the roles. So, this is fine when updating a user as the roles are then respected, even when the roles are omitted from the requestBody. However, the isConcurrent property (even when specified in the requestBody) can't be changed.

This means, if a customer wants to update the isConcurrent property they need to know the roles the user has. But they simple won't because they would only use the x-ignore-roles-if-missing=true feature when they don't know what the roles are. It thus doesn't really make sense to respect roles, but deny any update to isConcurrent.

The customer 'Co-op' requires the need to update a users' isConcurrent property and still have any assigned roles correctly respected even when not specified in the requestBody.

The customer 'Hilti' is also highly likely to need the same (currently checking with the CEE).

Need Development team to resolve this issue to ensure an 'Opt-in' pop up appears even in SSO situation to abide by GDPR rules.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. log in to SAC Tenant as an admin user.

2. Create a new user and open the initial invite email.

3. When the link is opened in the SSO scenario, a pop-up doesn't appear and when the link is opened in the Incognito window without SSO, then the below pop-up appears which is what is required even in the SSO scenario.

VW - if a user gets his roles removed in the VW IDP or leaves the company it will be removed via API from the SAC Tenant.

The DSGVO departments wants to have this user id in anonym way or deleted completely.

Once enabled, individual dimension values can be set for 'read' and/or 'write' permissions.

It means row level security for acquired data models is supported.

 !image-2021-09-20-09-44-03-409.png|thumbnail! 

The entries into this table can be:
* made manually by typing or selecting the user and/or team
* pasted (using the OS clipboard)

And if the dimension is a public dimension then you can also be
* updated (and on a scheduled basis) via a data source (potentially reading a database table for example once a day)

(There are a good number of limitation regarding the length and number of values that can be entered into a signal cell or entry)

Customers, however, need to programmatically update this table of access rights via an API to ease the integration with provisioning solutions (includes ones from SAP). However such solutions (including ones from SAP) don't offer an 'SQL' or query interface since such solutions are designed to call an API, like the SCIM API. 

*Thus this ER is for the current SCIM API to be extended to allow for this data access control 'table' to be updated for public and non-public dimensions for acquired (analytics and planning) models.*

The API should enable READ (to read all the current values) and to update one or all of them. Ideally, the API should support a PATCH call to either 'add' or 'remove' an individual (or team) to or from the 'READ' or 'WRITE' entries without the need to read and update all the entries (even for a single individual dimension value)

The limitation of the number of entries per 'cell' is out of scope for this ER, but should be handled separately. 

(Related info: limitation per cells is 30 users (and 30 teams?) per entry. But, if you cut and paste values into a single entry (a cell) you can specify a lot more than 30, you can specify up to a limit of 5000 characters!)

when importing master data from S/4HANA the value help for filter on members in the query does not list all values.

A BW query contains a characteristic and a hierarchy based on this characteristic where the characteristic contains??????*no text*??????but the hierarchy contains external characteristics that may contain texts.

In this case the client may not retrieve texts for the nodes in the hierarchy that contains external characteristics with texts. The reason is that the client can only requests texts based on the hierarchy base characteristic that has no text in this use case; in addition the concept of external characteristics is not exposed in BW InA, so it is impossible to requests texts for external characteristics.

To allow to retrieve texts in this use case the client may request the default text for the hierarchy base characteristic. In this case the BW InA protocol requests the default text for all external characteristics with texts contained in the hierarchy. In the BW InA protocol the client has to set the capa""TextInHierarchy""??to be able to use this feature. This note will be updated when SAC supports and uses this new capability.

h1. SAC solution
h2. We will introduce a formula for line item description

Official name: Dimension Comment

Official formula:??????_dimcomment_??????( [d/Dim 1], [d/Dim 2], [d/Dim 3] )

!image-2021-07-20-16-48-05-144.png|thumbnail!

!image-2021-07-20-17-10-42-876.png|thumbnail!
 * *Same storage(of sment*.?????? Use privilege concept of Comment Service, no further authorization concept??????
 * New formula ONLY supported under New Model if there is additional effort to support Account Model.
 * New formula is only possible with feature toggle on
 * *Existing comments need to be manually migrated*( i.e. export from table to xlsx and paste back)
 * *Same formula need to be repeated on each table widget* to show same MultiDimensionalAttribute.
 * *Measure independent*
 ** restricted measure is not relevant as measure is ignored

 * *Version dependent*
 * Any dimension included as POV should have *single value* specified either within row axis or filter( story/filter/table)
 ** example1,???????????????aaa?????????, ?????????bbb?????????, ?????????ccc?????????, ?????????ddd????????? are written on commenting key [d/Operating Product Group]=?????????Athletic Shorts?????????
 *** !image-2021-07-19-13-44-15-737.png|thumbnail!
 ** example2: [d/Audit] is not in table/filter but used in formula. AttributTrail_not_in_drill_filter.png|thumbnail!
 ** BHP need to consider dimension only appear in filter, example, BHP has dimension ?????????PlanYear????????? ( not a time dimension) filtered with single value in table. Different ?????????PlanYear????????? may have different description.
 * Attribute value should be shown for every member of dimensions which are in row but not used in formula
 ** [d/Operating Product Group] is not part of the commenting key hence we show comment for every dimension member of [d/Operating Product Group] in the slice
 *** !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail!
 ** if pasting different attribute values to these repeated attribute cells, the last one wins.
 * *Independent from data booking status*
 * Support *exporting* to Excel from table with POV
 * DimensionComment can also be *copied over from public version to private version* and then *published* into public version again. For UX, Dimension Comment reuses current comment checkbox in version management dialog.
 ** !image-2021-07-2nail!

h2. Dimension Comment formula
 * New formula syntax to be introduce for ?????????line item description????????? use case: = _dimcomment_??????( [d/Dim 1], [d/Dim 2], [d/Dim 3] )
 * New context menu entry to add as new calculation
 * DimensionComment column will be the *first column* after dimensions in row axis.
 * No association with any data column, no need to include ?????????Time-all?????????, no need to hide column.
 * In initial release, in one table widget, only accept *one definition* of such formula in *column* axis.
 * *Dimensions in row axis are mentioned in formula by default,* and user can modify the dimensions in formula on demand.
 ** For example,??????[d/Operating Account], [d/Operating Regions], [d/Operating Product Group] are selected as rows in table & hence used by default
 ** !https://wiki.wdf.sap.corp/wiki/download/attachments/2547533915/image2021-7-13_16-22-25.png?version=1&modificationDate=1626164547000&api=v2|height=250!
 * Disable planning functions for this formula* Only allowed context menu: remove column
 * This *new formula co-exist with data point comment in the same table widget is NOT supported* in the scope of this Jira
 * Hint of Dimension Comment formula??????[^dimension_comments_hint_box.docx]
 * No need to show Dimension Comment formula in table design panel. Screenshot below is showing data point comment formula in design panel, which does NOT apply to Dimension Comment formula
 ** !image-2021-07-27-16-06-27-486.png|thumbnail!

More detailed behavior about formula can be found in FPA00-40021
h2. Editing dimension comment (inline editing, copy&paste, deletion)
 * Double click into attribute cell, then edit *existing dimension comment like the way of editing data cell*.
 ** Note: different from data cell, there is *NO background color change* for dimension comment cells after value change.
 * User can *copy and paste* dimension comment values in same table, across tables within same table, across tables from another story, and from excel spreadsheet Pasted dimension comment will overwrite existing dimension comment
 * *Paste empty string(null or space) will delete existing comment,* user need to confirm this on popup(?)
 * *Copy & paste dimension comment and data in one shot*
 ** Technically, the request of saving dimension comment and the request of saving data are two separate ones. There might be the case that saving dimension comment succeeds but saving data fails, or vice versa.
 * Allow only plain text
 * User can *delete comment* via keyboard - delete, paste empty value, and enter empty value
 * *Is there any case that dimension comment cell should be input disabled*?
 * As comment is not revertible, after editing, this confirmation dialog should appear only once per session and per attribute column for any editing (inline editing, copy&paste, deletion).??????FPA00-40397
 ** !confirmation dialog.png|thumbnail!

 * Dimension Comment formula is not supported in mass data entry. In mass data entry, MDA formula also has cot pop-up behavior??????

since the last update (2018.6.2 / 2.19.0) the dynamic text elements for mobile devices are available. In my opinion a very good improvement.

The problem is, that the text element takes up too much space on the mobile phone and should be minimized to the minimum.

Enclosed you will find a screenshot.

From the comments on Influence request -

""Update from SAP: Development has determined that the text objects are always fixed to a 55px minimum in the mobile app. So it is not a bug because the app has always behaved this way. We're still tracking the enhancement, but the timeframe for resolution is unclear at the moment.""??

""Hello from customer,
is there any new information on this point?
Unfortunately I can't understand why the automatic height adjustment does not work for a header-elements? For standard text element the adjustment works fine!
Thank you

Details:

Refresh symbol is used for both refresh(or reload) of a chart and resetting a story causing confusion for users.?????? See screenshot.??????On the web one can find different symbol for 'reset'.

!image-2021-07-13-18-41-32-512.png|width=731,height=462!

And the main issue is that one function losses the filter value and other does not.?????? So for e.g. if the intention is to reset the entire story to the starting points before any actions a user performed in a session such as setting or changing filter values then an icon other than 'Refresh' should be used.

There is also an complain that when connection breaks or there is an issue where the data is not loaded, the user has to basically refresh each and every chart in story. At this point in time user will typically click the central refresh icon but that resets the entire storyll filters as mentioned above. This is more a UI bug than a feature request.",8,story
